<h2>CALVIN'S LETTERS.</h2>

<h3>Unpopularity of Calvin&mdash;various advices.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>September 1545</i>.]
</p>

<p>When a crowd of the godly had come hither, and I heard
some things which it was of great consequence you should know,
I wished two of them at once to set out for you. You will
understand that Satan seeks by every sort of artful contrivance
to keep all men from thinking of succouring these
people, and to give a keener edge to the ferocity of the King
and courtiers, which is already more than sufficiently whetted
against them. The Swiss also are uncommonly severe upon
me, not only the pensionaries, but all those who have no other
wisdom than that of Epicurus, because, by my importunity,
I have drawn down upon their nation the hatred of the
King. But may there be nothing of such moment as shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
retard us in the discharge of our duty beyond what cannot be
avoided.</p>

<p>Charles the schoolmaster, on whose account Sebastian abused
me, has deserted his post, induced by what prospect I know
not. We have appointed Francis his successor; but as he
had received one month's payment out of the salary of your
school, it seemed the more honourable course that he should
previously request permission and his discharge from the Bernese
Council, a matter in which, as I trust, there will be no difficulty.
A maternal uncle also of our colleague Peter sought a
recommendation [for him,] which he brings with him. If you
think it called for, you will likewise lend the aid of your suffrage.
We have always found him an excellent and ingenuous man,
peaceable and modest. He is said, for instance, to have
laboured faithfully, and with success, in the vineyard of the
Lord in Provence.</p>

<p>Adieu; may the Lord be ever present with you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Exhortation to glorify God amid poverty and persecution.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>September 1545.</i>]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Although I do not know the state of mind or
body in which you are at present, nevertheless, I have good
confidence in God that, whether in health or sickness, he gives
you strength to overcome all the annoyance you may have to
encounter. For you are no novice in the fight, seeing that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a long time past the good Lord has begun to prepare you for
it; and nothing has happened to you which you had not
looked for beforehand. But it is time to show in reality that
when you have set yourself frankly to follow Jesus Christ, you
have not done so without being resolved to hold fellowship with
him at the cross, since he has done us that honour to be
crucified in us, to glorify us with himself. And there is no
doubt, even at the time when you were in your own mansion,
and in the peaceable enjoyment of your property, you would
have had the courage to quit everything had it so pleased him,
and that you were of the number of those who <em>use the things
of this world as not abusing them</em>, (1 Cor. vii. 31.) But,
forasmuch as it is very reasonable that one should be taught
by experience to discern what our affection is most set
upon, you are to consider that it has been our Lord's will to
give you to many others for an example, and, by this means,
to glorify his name in you.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we know not what it is to part with
everything for the love of him, until he has brought us to the
test. True it is, that he who has taken off his affection from
the goods of this world has already sold all, and has made himself
poor, so far as depends upon himself; but the fruit and the
proof of this spiritual poverty are, patiently to endure the loss
of worldly goods, and without any regret, when it pleases our
heavenly Father that we should be despoiled of them. I do
not set these things before you as to one who is ignorant, or
who has need of lengthy remonstrances, but for the love that I
bear you, of which God is my witness. I take comfort along
with you, as I also suffer in your person.</p>

<p>The time then is arrived when you must manifest that you
reckon all things no more than dung, that you may reach forward
to Him who not only has bestowed on you all his benefits, but
also himself. And since God has permitted that you should be
disburdened of a part of your worldly goods, you are to consider
that he has clearly perceived that, for the present, they
would prove a useless fardel for you. I say a part, albeit that,
as it were, the whole has been snatched away from you, yet, so
that there remains, as I hope, an abundance for your use. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
whirlpools, however, which engulf the whole world, have daily
greater want than those whose substance they have swallowed
down.</p>

<p>In short, you have not been lessened one whit, seeing that our
Lord, while teaching you that your inheritance is in heaven, has
made provision for what might be useful for the life of the
body, by bestowing contentment upon you, and, as regards property,
more than was needful to make you contented. If the
whole should be taken away from you, there would yet remain
the consolation to which we must chiefly betake ourselves,
namely, to yield ourselves up entirely. It is certain, that having
the Son of God, we suffer no injury in being deprived of all
else: for thus highly ought we indeed to prize him. But
further, since this kind Saviour has so benignly upheld you,
that while calling you to the fellowship of his cross, he has
provided for your worldly comfort, it is quite fitting that you
submit yourself to his good pleasure, and, besides, rejoice that
in being minished, so far as the world is concerned, you are
thereby so much the more exalted before him and his angels.
For howsoever the world strives, by all means, to bury Jesus
Christ in ignominy, his burial cannot be otherwise than
glorious, not only in himself, but also in his members. Let
us therefore endure personal humiliation, as shall seem good
to him. But my letters would never come to an end were I to
follow out the drift of this discourse. Therefore, Monseigneur,
after having humbly commended me to your kind favour, I
pray our good Lord that he would so work in you now more
powerfully than ever, to make you despise all that is in the
world, and to make you breathe upwards direct to him with
your whole heart, without being turned aside by anything whatsoever,
making you taste what is the worth of the hope which
he reserves for us in heaven; and that it may please him to
lighten your burden as regards the body, in order that you may
be all the better disposed, well to meditate upon the favours he
has bestowed upon you, and to take delight in them, acknowledging
the love which he has shewn you. My wife, who is sick
in bed, begs also to be humbly commended to your kind remembrance.
This bearer, who is of the better sort, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
stamp such as you require, will inform you more at large concerning
our state.</p>

<p>

<h2>CXLVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Madame de Falais.</span></h2>

<h3>Congratulations on the constancy manifested by her in the midst of trials&mdash;salutations
from the suffering Idelette de Bure.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 18th September</i> [1545.]
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;I have not leisure to write at such length as I
willingly would, on account of the state in which we are. The
present letter shall be solely to praise our good Lord for the
trust which he has bestowed on you, enlarging your heart in
the midst of anxieties, by which it might have been tried, without
your having his comfort from on high. Whatsoever may
happen, if we have the patience to hearken to our Saviour, he
will always give us wherewithal to rejoice our spirits, and will
make us taste and feel, in a lively way, that it is not in vain
that he has promised to make us unconquerable in tribulations.
Now, then, learn in reality what that beautiful promise is worth,
that we are indeed happy, when all the world shall speak ill
of us, and shall hate us, and shall persecute us for his name's
sake. Therefore it is, that he has prepared you, long before
exposing you to danger. To this truth it is that you must
now recur, that you may acquiesce in it; and, indeed, he is
actually leading you thither by the hand.</p>

<p>Wherefore are we not together, to provoke Satan, by meditating
upon the things which may well cause us spiritual rejoicing,
and give us matter for glorying more than ever, even when
we are utterly discomfited according to the world's estimation?
But I am aware that you have no need of my fellowship in that;
and besides, I say so, more to content myself than because of
your necessity. Above all, understand that now the hour is
come when you must shew what a helpmeet you are to Monseigneur
your husband, in such a sort that he may always have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
occasion to bless God, as he has had hitherto, for having provided
him with such a support. I say this, because I consider
that it is the principal one that God has left him as regards
the creature, without having deprived him of all. I see clearly,
though absent, by what zeal you are urged forward to acquit
yourself of duty, and what trouble you take to employ yourself
therein. For which reason, what I now speak is not so
much by way of exhortation as, while congratulating, to uphold
you in that good courage which God has given.</p>

<p>I address to your care some reply which I have made to the
sister of Monseigneur, who is at Mons, to a communication
which she sent lately to the wife of Saint-André. If it seem
good to you, you can cause forward it to her, with this which
I send to the sister of Monsieur David. I submit the whole
to your good discretion.</p>

<p>To conclude, Madame and very honoured sister, after having
affectionately commended me to your kind favour, and having
also presented to you the humble commendations of my wife,
who lies sick in bed, I entreat our good Lord to fill you with all
grace, daily to increase his glory in you, and to triumph in
your constancy, in order that finally we may be also partakers
of his glory which he has promised us.</p>

<p>
Your servant and humble brother,

<h3>Vanity of trust reposed in the princes of this world&mdash;confidence in God.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I hope that, when these present shall reach
you, they will find you, by the favour of our kind Lord, in such
state of mind and bodily health as we desire, and likewise
Madame your wife. The news, however, which we have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the sickness of both has grieved us, and will do so until
we receive other which may gladden us. Besides, there is
reason indeed that we should live and that we should die to
Him who has purchased, in order to be every way glorified
in us, and that we shew practically that we are his, submitting
ourselves entirely to him in true obedience, which is not in our
power to do without resigning and giving up our persons to
him, so that he dispose of them as shall seem good to himself.
If it please him to prolong life, we must prepare to see
much poverty in the Christian Church. We see the dispersion
and complete disorder there is in it at present. Hope of amendment
there appears none on the side of the world; for to befool
one's-self in relying upon princes, that is labour lost. They
have, besides, so many hindrances, that they have not leisure to
think about what ought to be the chief consideration of all. In
short, they are entirely taken up with their civil state, for the
sake of which they will persecute Jesus Christ, thinking that
there is no other method of maintaining it. It will be nothing
new, however, if, though only for shame's sake, they should
make a pretence of applying a remedy for such horrible confusion,
on account of which both heaven and earth cry out.
Wherefore, it only remains for us to pray God that it may
please him to strengthen us with true constancy in the midst
of these scandals, in such a way that nothing may seduce us,
but that we may persevere always. And also, that he would
look in pity upon his Church, and put forth the hand to lift
her up again, fulfilling that which the prophet has said, that
<em>seeing that he had no helper among men, he has put forth the
strength of his arm</em>, (Isa. lix. 16.)</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us employ ourselves in his service, labouring
without growing weary or losing courage, until he
call us away into that blessed rest where we have contentment
in himself, delighting ourselves in the labours we shall have
undergone, receiving then the recompense of reward which shall
be there revealed to us.</p>

<p>Now therefore, Monsieur, after humble commendation to
your favour and that of Madame, I beseech the good Lord to
uphold you in real prosperity, continuing his graces in you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
so that to the end you may be instruments of his glory, and
that he may be your sanctification.</p>

<p>
Your servant and humble brother ever,</p>

<h2>CXLVIII.&mdash;To Farel.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h2>

<h3>Captivity of Farel's brother&mdash;ravages of the plague in Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>September 1545.</i>]
</p>

<p>You will hear sad news; for this person will inform you that
your brother Gautier<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is lying in fetters, and in imminent peril
of his life. The very thing that I always feared, and that I foretold
would occur, has happened; and in this I regret that I
have not proved a false prophet. But of what avail are such
complaints? With regard to helping him, I do not know how
far it is in the power of the Bernese to do so, nor what, at this
time, they may be willing to undertake. You will know these
things better than I. There is no hope of obtaining any
seasonable assistance from Germany, unless by means of John
Sturm, who, however well disposed he may be towards the
cause, is not, so far as things have gone, friendly to your
brother. Would that you had thought better, while there was
time, of what it is to offend a friend who deserved well. Besides,
you are not ignorant of the fact, that there are servile
persons who wish, at this time of the day, to approve their
obsequiousness to the princes. Yet, if you shall be of opinion
that it will be useful to attempt something in that quarter, your
influence with Sturm himself is great. You have, however,
your own Bucer, to whom he never ventured to refuse anything;
but it is a long circuit. Let him, therefore, accelerate
the movements of the Bernese, lest the remedy come too late.</p>

<p>We are surprised that we have had no announcement regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
yourself. Viret made me aware of the resolution that
had been come to by the brethren; but, as far as I can gather
from his letter, nothing has been done in the Council. How
long, therefore, will the matter remain in doubt? Here, as
you know, we are in great straits: you are away from us;
Matthæus is occupied in the hospital for those who are suffering
from the plague. In the meantime, while we are calling upon
you to come, we have lost our very excellent brother and
most faithful colleague Geniston.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> What if the others should
likewise be taken away? What if one only should survive, [I
myself?] What if the ministers be shut up by themselves,
through the absurd superstition of our townsmen?&mdash;just as
lately a large number was within a little of being so confined.
Consider, therefore, these our difficulties, lest you put us off
longer than is right. But what Viret mentions that your people
have added, viz: that you are conceded to us, on the condition
of our being able to bring about the succession of Toussain, is
certainly ridiculous; for what can we do in that matter, or in
what way shall we attempt the business? The short of it is, we
by no means prescribe a definite time, but we desire you to
use your utmost diligence to disengage yourself from the place
where you are, in order that you may forthwith repair to us
unfettered;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for we are now sadly in want of your presence, as
you may judge from our condition. The wife of Geniston is,
at the same time, in the death-throes, his little girl is wearing
away, and his little boy is now given over....</p>

<h2>CXLIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Viret.</span></h2>

<h3>Dispersion of the School at Geneva&mdash;contests at Neuchatel on the subject of church
property&mdash;Calvin's opinion of Farel.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>24th October 1545.</i>
</p>

<p>We shall wait until you either restore Francis to us, or
send Erasmus. As, meanwhile, the school is dispersed,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> you
must make haste. If both of these courses appear to you tedious,
or attended with difficulty, briefly signify so to us; for I will
send for a person from Strasbourg, who, in my opinion, will be
suitable, although I would rather have taken one from this
quarter. With regard to the <em>assistant-teacher</em>, I do not venture
upon anything, because it will be more satisfactory that the
person who has the superintendence of the school shall have
the unfettered power of selecting whom he chooses.</p>

<p>I had excused myself to Farel, but he remains fixed in his
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It would not only be ridiculous, but bordering on
imprudence, to undertake to correct in the Neuchatelese a vice
which here we are not able to cure. I had given it as my
advice, that it would be better to draw up a memorial, in which
the Princes should promise that they would be always ready to
make restitution, if an agreement could be come to regarding
legitimate administration. In the next place, I advised them,
under this pretext, to put a stop to those profane alienations, in
order that the matter might be left undecided until a more
favourable time. Farel replies, that the authority of the
Princes will not avail much. What confidence then will our
letter produce? He further urges me to enter into communication
with Bucer, in order to obtain from the Council of Strasbourg
a letter to the Council of Berne to this purport:&mdash;That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it had been pointed out to them that the Neuchatelese did very
wrong in squandering the goods of the Church; and that it
was the duty of the Bernese to check this license. He hopes
that a letter of that nature would also do good at Berne. I, on
the contrary, hardly think that the people of Strasbourg would
write such a letter, as they would be afraid of increasing
the sore. In the next place, if they should write, do we not
know that their admonition would be laughed at? And,
although the Bernese were in the highest degree desirous to
remedy this fault of the Neuchatelese, with what face could
they set about it? I have to implore that they will not venture
to reprehend in others that which they pertinaciously defend as
lawfully done by themselves. I may therefore say of Farel
what Cicero said of Cato, "That he acts indeed with good judgment,
but in counsel does not always shew the best." The
cause of this is chiefly, that being carried away by the vehemence
of his zeal, he does not always discern what is expedient, and
either does not foresee dangers, or despises them; and there is
to be added the evil, that he cannot bear with patience those
who do not comply with his wishes. But what could I do?
for I will not be induced to undertake anything which I think
will be of injurious tendency.</p>

<p>Christopher will tell you about Champereau,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and I will write
when the matter has come to an end. Adieu, most excellent
brother, and most sincere friend. I have not yet had an opportunity
of meeting Amédée. I will, however, fulfil your commission.&mdash;Adieu,
again, including your wife, aunt, and brothers.
The co-presbyters, my wife, and the neighbours respectfully
salute you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I hope that, according to what Antony
Maillet has latterly informed us, you are better in body and
mind than usual, for which I thank our good Lord, beseeching
him fully to confirm you; for I doubt not but the sickness has
left a long trail of feebleness. But He who has begun to raise
you up, will perfect, as I hope, what he has begun by his infinite
goodness, as well to grant the prayers of his servants as
to shut the mouth of the wicked, so that they take not occasion
to say that you have been overcome by their temptation;
for you are aware that they want not great colour for their

<h3>News from Germany&mdash;journey of the French Ambassadors to Geneva&mdash;details concerning
the condition of the town.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th January 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>There is nothing from your brothers since they passed
through this place. I briefly indicated my opinion to Viret
about the choice of a colleague for you. I am afraid that
further delay may involve a long train of inconveniences, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
I should wish to be guarded against. Feron, our brother,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> so
far as I see, will never have quiet of mind until he is translated
elsewhere. I had made mention of him to Viret, but it will
be for you to consider the matter.</p>

<p>My brother brought back no news from Germany, except
that the Ratisbon Assembly pretends that our party continue
their deliberations at Frankfort,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the confident report of a
league, or at least a friendly alliance, between your party and
the King. The Emperor was also said to be laid up with gout
in the feet or hands. The King's ambassador in that quarter,
when passing through, supped with me. We talked together
familiarly, for he acknowledges being under some obligation to
me. I again, however, urge you to beware lest our friends
prove too compliant. I point to the license that prevails over
the whole kingdom, of taking cruel measures against the godly.
We will await the issue. You are aware that the Pope is now
busying himself that, by means of false pretences, a council
may be held at Trent; we do not, however, hear that there is
to be a full convocation.</p>

<p>I wish that even one day could be given to a conference on
our affairs. As this, however, is for the present impossible, do
not needlessly vex yourself, should many reports be spread
abroad. There was, indeed, a time when we were on our guard,
when our party appointed sentinels for the gates, and were
usually more careful in keeping watch.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But they inconsiderately
gave a signal of alarm, without my knowledge, however,
and when I had not the smallest suspicion that anything of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
kind would take place.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Seizing the opportunity, our neighbours
[the Bernese] run to our aid, and most unreservedly offer
their assistance. No one had any suspicion of kindness so
obliging. Our friends make no communication to me, and after
speeches had been made backwards and forwards, an agreement
is come to between the parties. Shortly afterwards, there arrives
a new embassy with the most monstrous commissions. The
captain of the garrison, proffered by the Bernese, with his proposals,
having met with a refusal, has quitted the city.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I am
now aware how many various reports are everywhere circulated,
but I see no danger. Should you hear anything, deny
confidently the existence of any sort of alliance between us.
For presently, when they become ashamed of themselves, they
will have recourse to the old arts, saying that they are unjustly
defamed, &amp;c. I can hardly persuade our friends that
there is need of deeds on our side; nor is this wonderful, for
in other things they act foolishly in spite of my remonstrances.
Adieu, brother and most sincere friend. Salute for me, in the
kindest manner, all your co-presbyters and your family. May
the Lord direct all of you by his Spirit, and preserve you safe.</p>

<p>The impostor who had undertaken to carry Bucer's letter to
you, stopped at Montbeliard, nor would he ever have conveyed
it to you, had not my brother purposely set out for that place,
because he had in his keeping another of far greater moment.
He is a worker in gold by trade, but a fellow who is deserving
of the gallows.</p>

<p>I am so far convalescent as to be able for preaching and lecturing,
but am kept busy with arrears.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Since my written letter, I have changed my
mind, touching the epistle dedicatory of my Commentary, because
it is a great trouble and difficulty to be forced to fill up
so many pages and no more; I therefore send it altogether,
nevertheless, with this condition, that it shall not be printed
but by your command. Wherefore, I enclose it in the present
letter, in order that Vendelin<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> may not have it but from your
hands. Should it not appear fitting that I address it to you, I
shall make a new one, on being advertised to that effect. As
for the rest, do not be astonished if I speak with brevity of you,
for I would fear to touch some thorns in entering further on
the subject. But according as circumstances will bear it, we
can, should it so please God, on a second impression, discourse
fully and say all that there shall be need for. Howbeit, I
would greatly desire, if it might so please God, to be with you
for three or four days, to confer by word of mouth rather than
by writing. Possibly it is folly on my part to think that my
presence can be of any service to you. But why so? while the
power may be wanting, affection makes me speak thus. These
wishes, however, are more easy to form than to fulfil. So let
us be content with what God gives us.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had news here of the defeat of four thousand
English by five hundred light horse. But it is from France.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<h3>Rupture of the Relations between Calvin and Servetus.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 13th of February 1546.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seigneur Jehan</span>,&mdash;By cause that your last letter was brought
to me at my going away, I had not leisure to reply to what was
inclosed therein. Since my return, at the first leisure that I
have had, I have been quite willing to satisfy your desire; not
that I have had great hope of late of being profitable to a certain
person, judging from the disposition in which I see him to be;
but in order to try once more if there shall be any means of
bringing him back, which will be, when God shall have wrought
in him so effectually, that he has become entirely another man.
Since he has written to me in so proud a spirit, I would fain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
have beaten down his pride a little, speaking more harshly to
him than is my wont; but I could scarcely do otherwise. For
I do assure you that there is no lesson which is more necessary
for him than to learn humility, which must come to him
from the Spirit of God, not otherwise. But we must observe
a measure here also. If God grants that favour to him and
to us, that the present answer turns to his profit, I shall have
whereof to rejoice. If he persists in the same style as he has
now done, you will lose time in asking me to bestow labour
upon him, for I have other affairs which press upon me more
closely; and I would make a matter of conscience of it, not to
busy myself further, having no doubt that it was a temptation
of Satan to distract and withdraw me from other more useful
reading. And therefore I beg you to content yourself with
what I have done in the matter, unless you see some better
order to be taken therein.</p>

<p>Wherefore, after my commendation to you, I beseech our
good Lord to have you in his keeping.</p>

<h3>Reply to various questions&mdash;terrible threat against Servetus&mdash;imprisonment of one
of the leaders of the Libertins.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>13th February 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>You will be at ease regarding your brothers since you received
the letter of Claude. The messenger who brought it asked
whether mine would be ready when I returned from sermon,
after three o'clock. I replied in the negative; but I bid him
dine at my house with my wife, as I myself had been invited to
dine with Macrin. I promised to be with him immediately
after dinner, to make a brief reply. He did not come [to my
house,] but hurried away without waiting a moment, so that I
was confounded by so sudden a departure. And yet the youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
had not appeared to me to behave badly in general. I trust
the reflection may occur to your brothers, that they have
been thus extricated from all their difficulties by the hand of
God, in order that they make the greater haste [in the work.]
It did not become the Israelites, when a way was opened up to
them, to show remissness in immediately girding themselves for
flight.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Such would have been the burden of my epistle had
not the messenger deceived me; but I am confident that they
are burning with ardour of their own accord. I now come to your
own contests.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> If the ungodly still occasion you some trouble,
when that letter shall arrive, I have briefly expressed in it what
I think should be your mode of proceeding. I should wish,
however, the matter to be discussed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i>; and that, thereupon,
the result, or something like it, be committed to writing.
You will perhaps smile because I suggest nothing out of the
common, as you looked for something recondite and elevated at
my hands; but I do not wish, nor, besides, is it right to be fettered
by your estimate of me. I had rather, however, be foolish by
so writing, than by my silence lead you to suppose that your
entreaties were neglected by me. If nothing can be effected by
reasoning, and in this lawful way, the Bernese must be privately
prevailed upon not to allow that wild beast to go out of its den.
I do not sufficiently comprehend your meaning regarding a
treaty, unless it be, as I conjecture, that you are turning your
thoughts to some sort of alliance, with a view to your receiving
the assistance of the Bernese; and that just as they guard the
liberty of the people by the law of the state, so they may protect
ministers in their office by some title which commands
respect. If that be provided for, I do not disapprove of [the
alliance.] Bear in mind, that recourse should be had to those
extraordinary remedies only when there is the exculpatory plea
of an ultimate necessity. In the next place, be very cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
lest anything you do be such as may injure your interests in
time to come. You may have greater cause of regret in that
you once received aid, and were parties to a compact, than if
you were to remain in your original servitude. Marcourt has,
without doubt, already promised a place for himself; for he
publicly proclaims that he does not regard the consent of the
brethren, since he is desired, both by magistrates and people,
and he has no doubt but that they are indignant against
you. Finally, since he prematurely discloses the wickedness
of his character, he must be repulsed by all artifices, lest he
rise to a position in which he is able to perform what he
threatens. With regard to those who gave out that we were
establishing here a permanent seat of despotism, under colour
of defence, let us suffer this rumour to spread on both sides.
Their impudence has been met with civility and mildness, so
that they ought to be ashamed of themselves.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I trust that they
will keep quiet. I seek, as far as I am able, to persuade our
friends to remain unconcerned. Servetus lately wrote to me, and
coupled with his letter a long volume of his delirious fancies,
with the Thrasonic boast, that I should see something astonishing
and unheard of. He takes it upon him to come hither, if
it be agreeable to me. But I am unwilling to pledge my word
for his safety, for if he shall come, I shall never permit him to
depart alive, provided my authority be of any avail.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>More than fifteen days have now elapsed since Cartelier<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was
imprisoned, for having, at supper in his own house, raged
against me with such insolence as to make it clear that he was
not then in his right senses. I concealed what I felt, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
testified to the judge that it would be agreeable to me were he
proceeded against with the utmost rigour of the law. I wished
to go to see him. Access was prohibited by decree of the
Senate; and yet some good men accuse me of cruelty, forsooth,
because I so pertinaciously revenge my injuries.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> I have been
requested by his friends to undertake the part of intercessor.
I refused to do so, except on these two conditions, viz: that no
suspicion should attach to me, and that the honour of Christ
should remain intact. I have now done. I abide the judgment
of the Council.&mdash;Adieu, brother, and most sincere friend. We
all salute you and your sisters. You will convey to the
brethren the best salutations in my name, and that of my
brethren in the ministry. May God ever bless you and prosper
your labours.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Pacification of the Church at Neuchatel&mdash;report of the speedy arrival of the Emperor
in Savoy&mdash;dangers at Geneva&mdash;withering mention of Francis I.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>20th February 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>I specially congratulate you and all your friends, yea, ourselves
also, and the whole Church of Christ, that the Lord has
unexpectedly stilled all tumults, by restraining the ungodly.
Viret had already requested me to be prepared at all points in
case there should be need of my presence, and assuredly I
should not have been behind; but God is twice to be praised,
who by his own counsel has adjusted matters that were in so
great confusion. We acknowledge that he was present with
you when he opened up to you that plan of admonishing the
heads of the citizens. We again acknowledge a memorable
work of his, in having given to you those who of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
accord were disposed to act well towards you. I feel confident
that the matter has been brought to a conclusion in harmony
with the desire of all good men. If our service be desired,
you know that we are all yours. I now hourly expect your
brothers. May the Lord restore them to us safe and with good
fortune.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> A confident report is spread abroad here of the
arrival of the Emperor. I hold it for certain that a passage
across will by no means be opened up to him without a bloody
conflict. It cannot be doubted, that even though our neighbours
were willing that we should be left exposed to the danger
of becoming the prey of the conqueror, they would nevertheless
find it necessary to guard their own territories; although I do
not know why our party have so soon become careless, unless
they wished to subject themselves to their sway, and thus save
themselves from other masters. It is a hard condition that you
must give up your liberty in order to secure allies as defenders.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Our party erred in one particular, that they made too violent a
reply. But what could I do? On me, nevertheless, the odium
redounds, though I strove with great vehemence to prevent the
ground of it; but I have bid adieu to the perverted judgments of
men. I pass on to another subject. Matters will go more
severely with Cartelier, because he mixed up with myself part of
the Senate. After that I have respectably enough discharged the
duty of clemency, I have resolved to halt. The malevolent will
heap obloquy upon me, but if there be an opportunity of replying,
I have the means of stopping their mouths. No one certainly
will allege that any word less than fair fell from me, for among
good and bad I have endeavoured to extenuate his offence.
The Parliament of Paris, as I hear, now wages war with fire
and faggot against Christ.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is indeed certain that a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

meanwhile, in the midst of his courtezans, feeds
his fancy with victories. May the Lord have respect to his
Church!</p>

<p>Adieu, most upright brother in the Lord, together with all
your fellow-ministers, whom you will respectfully salute in my
name, and in that of the brethren. May Christ ever direct you
all by right counsel, and bless your auspicious endeavours.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Election of a minister at Neuchatel&mdash;sickness of Viret's wife.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>22d February 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>I learned from Farel's last letter, that the commotions at Neuchatel
were allayed. And I now feel assured that the matter
of the choice of a pastor is concluded; for it had at length been
agreed that the ministers should promise on oath to nominate in
good faith the person whom they deemed most suitable. It
was already considered as almost certain, that Christopher
would be the man, provided the Bernese would part with him;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and there is hope that they will offer no objection. Farel wrote
that the good cause had been not a little aided by the Consul
Wateville.</p>

<p>Had they invited us as brethren, I should have been ready at
any hour. But I rejoice especially, that you were of more service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
than you thought you would be; for all loudly assert that
your arrival was highly advantageous.</p>

<p>I see that Textor does not hold out much further hope of
your wife. You need no more words to admonish you to hold
yourself ready to bear with moderation the issue, whatever that
may be. Would that I also could fly thither, that I might
alleviate your sorrow, or at least bear a part of it!<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But so
long a ride would cause me pain. I rather advise, should
matters happen otherwise than as we wish, that you come
hither for a few days.&mdash;Adieu, most sound-hearted brother,

strengthen you all. Amen.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>Come, on this condition, that you disengage your mind not
only from grief, but also from every annoyance. Do not fear that
I will impose any burden upon you, for through my means you
will be allowed to take whatever rest is agreeable to you. If any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
one prove troublesome to you, I will interpose. The brethren,
also, make the same promise to you as I do. I will also be
surety that the citizens do not interfere with your wishes.</p>

<p>I know not what I ought to imprecate on the wretches who
had spread a report of your death. Never did a letter from
you arrive more opportunely. Although your death was
announced, yet as mention was made of poison, Textor was
already in the midst of preparations for the journey, that he
might speed to Orbe on fleet horses. A great part of the brethren
were present, all overwhelmed with deep affliction.
Shortly afterward your letter made its appearance, and such
exultation instantly broke forth, that we were hardly masters
of our senses. It was fortunate that we did not pass a night
of sorrow, else I should not have borne it without danger.
But why do I detain you, and not rather incite you to hasten
hither as quickly as possible? Adieu, brother and most agreeable
friend. Salute respectfully the brethren James, Ribitti,
Hubert, Cordier, Celio, Francis, Merlin. The Lord protect
you and the remainder of your family.&mdash;Yours,</p>

procured than it could have been eight days ago, for fewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
couriers have passed this way during these days. Make haste,
therefore, that you may recruit a little, and gather heart again

<h3>Indication of the various documents wherein are set forth the opinions of

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>17th March 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>Your letter gave me the greater pleasure, as I had not ventured
to look for it, for it was my part to draw a letter from
you by being the first to write. But that you, without being
called upon, should of your own accord have anticipated me, I
take as a proof of your greater friendship towards me. If, however,
you would know the reason of my not writing, I refrained
more from modesty than negligence. And generally the testimony
of Philip [Melanchthon] is with me sufficient; but when
no great familiarity intervenes, the crooked policy of the times
sometimes makes me apprehensive. Wherefore, I am the more
grateful to you for having removed every scruple. I greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rejoice, also, to find that my pamphlet, <cite>De Coenâ</cite>, has met
with your approbation.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It was written in French ten years
before. When, without my knowledge, it had been already
translated into Latin by two individuals, I at length consented
to its publication, being afraid, in fact, that some worse version
might forestall it. A style of instruction, simple and popular,
and adapted to the unlearned, shews what my purpose was from
the first; for I usually write more carefully for those acquainted
with Latin. I laboured, however, not only faithfully to express
my views, and reduce them within a brief compass, but also to
unfold them lucidly, and without technicalities. Since then
the <cite>Institution</cite>, having been revised, was again given to the
public, in which, unless I am mistaken, I expound and more
fully confirm the same doctrine, under a different form of expression,
and with somewhat greater development. I at length
also published a <cite>Catechism</cite>, which is trustworthy and pertinent
evidence of the kind of doctrine with which the common people
are imbued by me. Would that the people of Zurich, as you
say, were willing to give their assent to that confession!<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I
do not think Luther is so unyielding but that there might easily
be an agreement, and they do not, withal, venture to disapprove
of my views. The chief obstacle to their giving a public assent
to my doctrine is, that being pre-occupied by a meaning, once
and now for a length of time prescribed to them, they so stick
to their customary forms as to admit nothing new. But if you
consider the tyranny manifested by certain of the adverse party
in the attempt to force the world, not only into their peculiar
views, but also into a prescribed form of words, the furious
insolence they shew, what commotions they excite,&mdash;the moderation
as well as rectitude by which you are characterized, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
lead you to condemn in the matter the absurd conduct of those
parties, not less than the people of Zurich. May the Lord by
his Spirit dispose us all to true moderation. You know that I
am not in the habit of complaining when there is no ground
for it; nor do I doubt but that you yourself, as might be expected
from your eminent piety, sigh in secret over the same
evils, while it is not in your power to remedy them. With
respect to the assurances you give me regarding yourself, I
wish you in turn to believe, that I am and always will be your
sincere friend and brother. I now, with many others, request
you to go on strenuously, and make no halt in your progress,
until you have handed over to us Genesis completed.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> For as
Luther has just grounds for congratulating himself in having
found such an artist to polish his works, so others experience
how advantageous the labour is to the public. I may have
wished, however, that you had been more sparing in your
mention of the Sacramentaries, because I see that the minds
of some are thereby exasperated, of whom there was a hope
that they would be brought to moderate views. It will be for
you to consider what may be more conducive to that end. I
will be satisfied if you take my warning in good part, whether
or not you act upon it. The Ratisbon Assembly will indeed
bring forth smoke for us, which the Lord will soon dispel.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Here we are tranquil unless the Emperor molest us. Some
suspect him of having an eye on Burgundy, with the view of
threatening the kingdom of France from that quarter, while he
would harass Provence by means of the young Duke of Savoy,
and send in the English from the other side. I hold myself
under the protection of God alone when I see that we are not
far from certain danger. Adieu, most honoured sir, and most
sincere friend. May the Lord Jesus ever guide and direct you
by his Holy Spirit, and bless your labours. All my colleagues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
respectfully salute you. To yours also you will convey the
highest respects in my name, and in that of my colleagues.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Instructions to Viret about a journey to Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th March, before supper</i>.
</p>

<p>The person who delivered yours to me did not know whence
it came. I thus received it somewhat later than I wished.
I attended to the wish you expressed, that a suitable horse,
and one without show, should be sent to you. It would,
however, have been sent off sooner, had I not told our people
beforehand that you could not leave your place of residence
before the morning discourse. I certainly could have wished,
if your letter had arrived in time, that you had been sent for
sooner. But I supposed that you had set out with Christopher:
for that was the reason why I gave you no letter by the
messenger belonging to my household. If, after preaching,
you can come as far as Nyon, you will be here on Monday
before supper; but take care lest you fatigue yourself. You
had better come to Nyon on Monday. We shall have you
with us in good time, if we get you well. Salute all the brethren.</p>

<p>May the Lord bring you to us safe and in good spirits.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Calvin's labours&mdash;the diet at Ratisbon&mdash;the Church at Metz&mdash;the reformation at
Heidelberg&mdash;<cite>apology</cite> for M. de Falais&mdash;opinion regarding the sermons of Ochino.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>April 1546.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I thank you for the care which you have of
my health, anxious that I would not overburthen myself, in
straining a point to write to you, when I am not in a fit state
to do so. But had I only to write to you, it would be to me a
very easy labour, if that can be called toil wherein one only
finds pleasure. The difficulty arises from the annoyances and
interruptions of the train of thought which intervene, to break
off a letter in the midst twenty times over, or even more, beyond
all bounds. As regards health, I was much more feeble when
I wrote to you a while ago than I am at present. But being
in a good state of general bodily condition, I am unceasingly
tormented with a heaviness, which, as it were, suffers me not to
do anything. For, besides the sermons and lectures, there is a
month already gone in which I have scarce done anything, in
such wise that I am almost ashamed to live thus useless. But
if it please God, of his goodness, to make use of me, he will
release me and allay this ill, which holds me so fast that I cannot
set about any labour of importance, to employ the leisure
which he gives me. Nevertheless, he does not cease to exercise
me by some means or other, in order that I may not grow rusty
through laziness. If, however, he does not graciously restore
me to a better condition, I am not likely ever to get on horseback.
Even more than that, were I ever to be sent for, I could
not stir out of the house in such a state. But, as you observe,
they let me alone, from fear of setting astir the frantic blockheads;
and on my side, I willingly give up the diets to those
who have a liking for them, as for any good they do.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
glad that our Lord has put you out of pain as regards Norberg.
As for what remains to be done, you will have an opportunity
of considering what it ought to be, having been informed by
Jéhan de Rochefort, and after having established your case, as
it can be done, in coming forth out of Egypt and out of
Babylon. It is like what is said by Moses and by Ezekiel,&mdash;<em>in
much stir and with haste</em>. I hope, should it so please God,
that all is over by this time. I would not have you to be too
much astonished at the length of time you have been in receiving
letters from him, considering the length of the journey.
But if God has been so gracious to him, and to you also, as to
make a way of escape out of danger, he will not have tarried
so long on the way as not to be, by this time, on his return.
Thus, being at rest in regard to that matter, you will take
counsel for the future.</p>

<p>As to Constance, I had not spoken to you, but that your
present abode did not please you. When the crisis comes, however,
Strasbourg is more suitable, and I like it better, were it
not for the reason which you allege.</p>

<p>In Metz,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> I see a great evil, the want of guidance and of
cordial interest, albeit that these are rather two evils. But
God will find the remedy. We must try every method which
he presents to us, and even stir up ourselves, where the means
appear to be wanting. And whereas I know that you have
no need to be exhorted not to spare yourself, I forbear to
do so.</p>

<p>I am not at all amazed, if Master Peter Alexander is bold,
having his chin thus held above water, and that besides he is
quite accustomed at Heidelberg to hear that doctrine already
for a long time past.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He is even well aware that he has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
other means for advancing himself. Thus it is no wonder if
he takes advantage of it where there is no danger at all. But
I see quite well that he is not an over-confident man, were it
only by his conclusions. What is worse, he makes a stupid
blunder in this, that he says, the swearing an oath is forbidden
by God; and that with a blasphemy, inasmuch as he attributes
authority to Saint Paul to permit what has been prohibited by
his Master; but these are matters for the civil magistrate to
decide.</p>

<p><cite>The Apology</cite> would be much better drawn up where you are
than at a distance. This I say not to exempt myself, but inasmuch
as I think that such is the case; for I am quite ready
to undertake the employment. So also would Master Peter
Viret, but his style of writing would not be altogether suited
to such an argument, owing to his want of conciseness. And
for myself I would have to bite my nails in more than a hundred
passages, if we could not confer together so as to resolve
by common accord what might be fit to say or to omit. Nevertheless,
we shall take care to meet your wish whenever you
shall have come to a determination upon the whole case and
the state of your affairs. Howbeit, I have retained no memorandum
of the particulars beside me. What I have told you
about the Emperor, was not so much to find fault with what
has been done, as to set forth the reason why it ought not to
be inserted so as to be seen. I praise our Lord that the present
of my Commentary is agreeable to you. In conformity
with your answer, our brother sent his translation to Vendelin,
addressing the preface to you, in order that having seen it
beforehand, you may judge what course shall appear to you to
be expedient.</p>

<p>The request which I made to you so affectionately, not to
separate your household from the French Church,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> was not
founded upon any report, but solely upon a passage of your letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
where you signify that you were in course of doing so, not
perceiving any amendment in that quarter. It suffices, that I
am aware of your intention, so as not to be further troublesome
to you on that score. I see indeed the reasons you may
have, but I take into view the scandal which would thence
arise. All is well, since you have condescended to my request.</p>

<p>I would desire, Monseigneur, that the hundred crowns [escus]
might be sent to the lady, and they would be returned to you
forthwith, sending to the Ladies de Tilly what is resting due
to them, since the father shews himself such a one as he is. I
would earnestly wish, that in disposing ourselves willingly
and patiently to bear the cross, we were framing our shoulders
to such a charge. But these are matters about which we shall
better talk together than we can write.</p>

<p>I pray you to hold me excused, if I do not as yet signify my
opinion of the translation of the Sermons of Messire Bernardino.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
I may, however, speak a word in your ear, that they
are more useful in Italian than in other languages, were it not
that the name of the man is of use; and then there is such a
variety of minds, that it is not amiss to endeavour to draw
some of them by that means. Of the translator, I shall let you
know my opinion, please God, in a few words shortly.</p>

<p>As touching the <em>apology</em> of the ladies,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> I think, Monseigneur,
you have my opinion of it signified already in brief, at least I
would here declare it, that the author has not observed what
the Latins call <em>decorum</em>. For the course of procedure is unbefitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the individuals. Everybody will not perceive this,
only those who have their wits about them. This is the reason
why I have retained it beside me.</p>

<p>The letters of Diaz<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> were not needed to shew me on what
authority you had opened those which he might write to me.
For you have sufficient authority without any one else giving
it to you. I humbly thank you for the offer which you have
so kindly made for the baptism of our child.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> And now,
Monsieur, to conclude, after having humbly, and with all possible
kindly affection, commended me to your good favour and
that of Madame, and having also presented the humble salutations
of my wife, I pray our good Lord to guide you always as
he has done, shewing himself the true protector both of you
and of all that concerns you.</p>

<p>Your humble brother, servant, and ever your entire friend,</p>

<h3>Advice regarding the editing of the <cite>Apology</cite>&mdash;details of a loan contracted for M. de
Falais&mdash;news from Germany and Italy&mdash;Farel and Viret at Geneva&mdash;death of
Juan Diaz.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>16th April 1546.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;You see here what I have done desiring to
comply with your wish.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> That it shall altogether satisfy you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I shall not venture to promise myself. It will be quite enough
for me if you have the persuasion that I have not failed from
lack of good-will. Indeed, I fear you may not find that which
you had looked for. But it is not reasonable that I bear the
blame of the too great credit which I may have with you. If
I had been in a right frame, and had I had leisure, possible
it is that I might have done better. But since these two things
have been wanting to me, I pray you that you may please
hold me as excused. It would not have cost me very much to
fill up a much larger extent of paper; but I have studied
brevity, thinking that nothing could be better, considering the
personage to whom the writing is addressed. It did not occur
to Saint André that it wanted anything, except that, on having
come to the passage about your retirement, you might insist
upon deducting separately in detail the travelling expenses
which you had incurred up to that time. I had, indeed, thought
of another conclusion to be urged, but because I did not well
know how to keep within bounds, I have let it alone. You
will exercise your own discretion as to adding an article to
that effect, if you think fit, namely, with regard to the property,
which you did not venture to make any other request to
him about, fearing that it would be trouble thrown away, to
speak to him about the property before being reinstated in his
good graces, and also because that is the thing you most of all
desire and prefer to anything else. In any event, let it please
him to have regard to such a family, and not allow himself to
be led by those who only seek its destruction. I know not
whether it would be of advantage to your brothers<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
mention of them. You will consider about that. Towards the
end, it would be needful to add an express clause, to remove
the suspicion that you had too great regret, declaring that for
the honour of God you bear the loss patiently, beseeching God
that he would always make you sensibly aware of the work of
Jesus Christ, and of the benefits bestowed on you by him, so
as to reckon all things but loss and dung in comparison of him.
If you determine to enter upon the subject of the property, it
appears to me that it would be advisable to mention it thus
briefly; I have explained the reason why I have not done so.</p>

<p>But to proceed, Monseigneur, I have detained the man who
has brought me your last, hoping that he would be the messenger
to carry you this answer. But, at the end of six days,
there has occurred a sudden piece of business to Sire Nicolas
the present bearer. I have thereupon sent away the other,
delivering to his care the two young children, because he could
not have arrived so soon. He has been sufficiently admonished,
not so much by me as by the others, to settle and choose some
manner of livelihood; but I see clearly that he is not yet tired
of running about. That arises in part from his too great simplicity,&mdash;for
he has no great head-piece. Some clodpole, scarcely
wiser than himself, had whispered in his ear in passing, that I
would be quite able to recommend him to Berne, and put him
in the way of his becoming a preacher. I have done everything
to repress such an expectation: but he does not leave
off his roving about; and although he seems to approve an
advice when offered to him, immediately afterwards he begins
to do the same thing again. I am sorry for it, for in other respects,
I find him well disposed, and without malice.</p>

<p>As for the business of Sire Nicolas, the case is thus:&mdash;He had
no means of squaring his accounts, but in taking the place
which had been adjudged in hypothec to another preferable
creditor, having struck off some pieces for law expenses. Thus
he would have been excluded, had he not undertaken to reimburse
the other party. What is worse, he who held the security
was himself under hypothec elsewhere, in danger that his property
might be sold, and needed to re-assure his interest therein.
The subject is well worth what the said Nicolas has bargained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for. The hardship was for him, that he would have had to pay
seven hundred crowns before next Easter, and also that it is
too large for him. But the necessity made him forget all that.
It is true that he has to receive from Sire Antony Sieglessen
a sum in satisfaction thereof, but he fears that it may not be
ready at so short a term, seeing that he will have to transact
with people who have no pity. In that perplexity, he has
thought that if, peradventure, Antony de Sieglessen might not
so readily be forthcoming with that which he has to receive
from him, you would afford him some assistance, for a
month, or six weeks' delay, on his giving you the security of
Sire Antony and the place, on good and equitable terms.
When he asked advice of me, I requested him to try all means
before having recourse to you, which he had already indeed
determined, as he told me, but that it was his last remedy. In
any event, however, he would bring you letters of assurance
over the place. To this I have not agreed, fearing lest it might
appear to you that it would have the effect of protracting a
settlement, promising to him to assure you that the responsibility
lies not with himself but with me.</p>

<p>I have wished much to make this statement to you, Monseigneur,
on purpose that you should be informed, that he did not
rashly go beyond his authority, but that he had been constrained
thereto; in order also, that when he could nowise do without
your help, you might the more be induced to aid him. I can
indeed assure you, that there will be no risk, for the assignment
is quite valid. And if money were to be had here, he would
not need to stir out of the house. But the country is stripped
so bare of money, that it is lamentable, the more so that there
is more due to him at Strasbourg than he has need for. I do
not take upon me to ask it of you, for that is not my business.
In so far as I have endeavoured to remove the doubts which
might prevent you, I hope you will take it in good part, and
that you will not ascribe it to importunity. Besides that, it is
my duty, for I have been the cause, along with Monsieur David,
of involving him in this anxiety. For we made the first purchase
in his absence, because the said Monsieur David was fully
resolved from that time forward to complete the transaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe that you have been otherwise informed of the death
of the Marquis of Guasto.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> We are not aware what the
Emperor intends to do, except that people are coming from
Naples toward Genoa. One can scarce think that he would go
so far for pastime as to Argiers. And, indeed, I believe, that
considering himself secure upon the side of France, and leaving
the English to occupy the King's attention, having fully ordered
everything to his own advantage in Germany, he would not
make a mere feint of going to Argiers.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Master William Farel and Master Peter Viret, in passing
from hence, have requested me to present you their humble
commendations. They have been here eight days to my great
comfort, except in so far as they have made me put off my excusing
myself to you. I am glad of your well-disposedness,
and principally for your cheerfulness, and also because I hope
that it will prove a means of our seeing you. We shall, in the
meanwhile, however, pray God, that he would restore you from
better to better, albeit that we must not look, neither you nor
myself, to be ever of much worth in this world.</p>

<p>We have made Saint-André preacher, at which possibly you
will be amazed. He did not look for it; and I believe also,
that at the first move his courage would not have inclined him
that way. But we have made conscience of it, seeing his zeal
and readiness, not to leave him always idle. I hope that God
will make use of him for the profit and upbuilding of his
Church. He has not been brought to it without a struggle,
but perceiving that the call was from on high, he has not resisted
it.</p>

<p>To conclude, Monseigneur, after having presented the humble
commendations as well of myself as of my wife to your kind
favour and to that of Madame, I shall supplicate our good
Lord to have you always in his protection, guiding you with a
view to his honour, as he has done hitherto, and shewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
himself so powerful in you, that we may always acknowledge
the fruit of that great victory with which Jesus Christ consoles
us.</p>

<h3>Troubles at Geneva&mdash;imprisonment of the several members of the family of Favre&mdash;account
of the assassination of John Diaz at Neubourg.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>April 1546.</i>]
</p>

<p>After your departure the dances caused us more trouble than
I had supposed. All those who were present being summoned
to the Consistory, with the two exceptions of Corna and Perrin,
shamelessly lied to God and us. I was incensed, as the vileness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the thing demanded, and I strongly inveighed against
the contempt of God, in that they thought nothing of making
a mockery of the sacred obtestations we had used. They persisted
in their contumacy. When I was fully informed of the
state of the case, I could do nothing but call God to witness
that they would pay the penalty of such perfidy; I, at the
same time, however, announced my resolution of unbaring the
truth, even though it should be at the cost of my own life, lest
they should imagine that any profit was to come of lying.
Francisca also, the wife of Perrin, grossly abused us, because
we were so opposed to the Favres.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I replied as seemed proper,
and as she deserved. I inquired whether their house was inviolably
sacred, whether it owed no subjection to the laws?
We already detained her father in prison, being convicted of
one act of adultery,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> the proof of a second was close at hand;
there was a strong report of a third; her brother had openly
contemned and derided the Senate and us. Finally, I added,
that a new city must be built for them, in which they might
live apart, unless they were willing to be restrained by us here
under the yoke of Christ; that so long as they were in Geneva,
they would strive in vain to cast off obedience to the laws;
for were there as many diadems in the house of the Favres as
frenzied heads, that that would be no barrier to the Lord being
superior. Her husband had meanwhile gone to Lyons, hoping
that the matter would be silently buried. I thought that they
should be forced to a confession of the truth by an oath. Corna
warned them that he would by no means suffer them to perjure
themselves. They not only confessed what we wished, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
they, on that day, danced at the house of the widow of Balthazar.
They were all cast into prison. The Syndic was an
illustrious example of moderation; for he publicly spoke
against himself and the whole herd so severely, that it was unnecessary
to say much to him. He was, however, severely admonished
in the Consistory, being deposed from his office until
he gave proof of repentance. They say that Perrin has returned
from Lyons; whatever he may do, he will not escape punishment.
Henry was stripped of his office with our consent. With
him there fell out a ludicrous enough altercation. He had
admitted that what had been taken down from the witnesses
was true. Meanwhile he had recourse to the defence, 'Against
an elder admit no accusation unless before two or three witnesses.'
I inquired whose saying this was,&mdash;'Out of thine
own mouth I judge thee, worthless servant;' for that now
the case did not lie in the trustworthiness of the witnesses,
but in his confession. Besides, when he repudiated the witnesses,
that he was pressed by the dilemma, either his confession was
true or it was false: if true, there was no further ground for
hesitation; but if he had said what was false, he was to be
held as answerable for perjury, because he had sworn to something
different from the reality. It therefore came to this, that
he might say that he had spoken falsely and without regard to
principle. When he said that it was unfair that he should be
pressed by one who ought to have been his defender, I inquired
by what obligation I was bound to him to defend a bad cause,
for that I had taken no oath to the Franciscan faction. Much
was said to the man, backwards and forwards, but the result
was, that he departed loaded with the reproach and odium of
all. Being deprived of his ministry, he was, at the same time,
thrust into prison, whence, however, he was liberated in three
days. There he was a strenuous patron of the dances, that he
might embitter, as far as was in his power, the hatred towards
me of those who were already more than sufficiently alienated
from me. But whatever Satan may essay by the like of him,
he will afford a striking example. For two things are already
matter of public talk, that there is no hope of impunity since
even the first people of the city are not spared, and that I show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
no more favour to friends than to those opposed to me. Perrin
with his wife rages in prison; the widow is absolutely furious;
the others are silent from confusion and shame.</p>

<p>Diaz, the Spaniard, whom you saw here, Viret, at the house
of Des Gallars, and who, setting out from Neuchatel for Germany,
had passed through with the two Senarclens, was most
cruelly put to death. When the Emperor was said to be approaching,
he had repaired to Neubourg, a town under the rule
of Duke Otho Henry. From that place he wrote to me on the
13th of March. He had a brother at Rome of the name of
Alphonso, who came thither with the express design of making
away with this godly man. They conferred together for some
days. When Juan observed that he was of no service, he left
Alphonso. The latter, pretending that he had forgotten something,
sends a servant to recall his brother, and put him to
death in the house. He followed him to the house, nor did
he believe the domestic that the slaughter had been perpetrated
until he himself had viewed the corpse. Then he hurried
off on fleet horses to the county of Tyrol.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Duke Otho sent the
prefect of the palace to demand that he should be given up to
punishment. Unless Ferdinand be willing to throw into confusion
all things, both human and divine, he must of necessity
avenge so base and abominable an outrage. For the prefect
has at the same time surrendered himself a prisoner.</p>

<p>Adieu, dearest brethren; may God ever protect you. Salute
all friends. You, Farel, will convey to the heads of the citizens
my best greeting. I wish that I could one day creep your
length, in whatever way it might be possible.&mdash;All ours salute
you.</p>

<h3>Complaints regarding the conduct of Perrin&mdash;firm and courageous declaration by the
Reformer of his resolution to persevere in his duty unto death.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>April 1546.</i>]
</p>

<p>I should willingly have met you, Lord Captain, had it not
appeared to me that a different course was expedient. You
will have an opportunity of hearing the reason from me at a
proper place and time. I could have wished, however, that you
had appeared at the Consistory, by way of example to others.
As in that respect you did not do your duty, because you had perhaps
not been warned, I desired you at least to be present at the
close of the meeting to-day, that the Syndic Corna and I might
there discuss the matter with you. What there was to prevent
you I do not see. But this I wish you to consider, that we can not
enjoy weight for weight with an unequal balance; and if impartiality
must be observed in the administration of human law, any
departure from it cannot be tolerated in the Church of God. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
yourself either know, or at least ought to know, what I am;
that, at all events, I am one to whom the law of my heavenly
Master is so dear, that the cause of no man on earth will induce
me to flinch from maintaining it with a pure conscience. I
cannot believe that you yourself have any other end in view, but
I observe that no one has his eyes wide enough open when the
case is his own. As far as I am concerned, I desire, in this
very matter, to consult not only the edification of the Church
and your salvation, but also your convenience, name, and
leisure; for how odious would be the imputation which is likely
to fall upon you, that you were apparently free from and unrestrained
by the common law, to which every one is subject? It
is certainly better, and in accordance with my zeal for your
welfare, to anticipate the danger than that you should be so
branded. I have heard, indeed, what has proceeded from your
house, viz., that I should take care lest I stir up a slumbering
fire, lest what occurred before should again take place, in the
course of the seventh year. But these speeches have no weight
with me; for I did not return to Geneva either for the sake of
leisure or of gain, nor will it again grieve me to be constrained
to leave it. The convenience and safety of Church and State
made me willing to return; and if measures are now being
taken against me alone, I should wish it to be said, once for all,
to all who think me troublesome, "What you do, do quickly."
But yet, the unworthy treatment and ingratitude of some
parties will not cause me to fail in my duty, and I will lay
aside that devoted attachment to this place only with my last
breath, of which I take God as my voucher. Nor will I ever
so far yield to the humours of any other individual, as hereafter
to dispense with his personal attendance. These observations
do not refer to you, but to that member of your family
that is nearest to you. Nor do I write them with the view of
spreading quarrels, but that it may be manifest with what firmness
I am about to proceed, whatever may happen. I am
especially desirous to impress upon you the necessity of earnestly
seeking to acquire the primary virtue of obedience to
God, and respect for the common order and polity of the Church.
May the Lord protect you by his own defence, and discover to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
you how greatly even the stripes of a sincere friend are to be
preferred to the treacherous blandishments of others!&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h3>Requests in favour of the faithful in France.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>1st May 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>This pious brother is a citizen of Uzés,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> a place where many
have been utterly ruined by the severity of the ungodly. They
have all agreed to try whether any succour is to be found
among the Germans. I replied, that I had somewhat greater
hope to-day, in that our princes have shewn, by clear indications,
their aversion from imprisoning. I had, besides, been
reminded that there was a certain person at Worms, sent by the
Dauphin, who makes many promises. I am, indeed, aware of
the hollowness of courts, but there will be no harm in making
trial. I should not have refused what they strenuously insisted
upon, viz., that I should undertake this journey, were I not still
a prisoner, so slow is the process of my convalescence. I hardly
know what progress I have hitherto made towards recovery,
unless that my sufferings are allayed.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> I have, therefore, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
this duty to one of you. Whoever of you finds it convenient
will provide the expenses. As you, Viret,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> are on the eve of
setting out for Berne, it is right that our friend Farel be relieved
by you of this burden, if the Senate give its permission. But
if you shall not be free to go, Farel himself, I know, will spare
neither himself nor his age; certainly otherwise he will be
absolutely indispensable. Wherefore, if leave of absence be
denied to Viret, take care you do not fail, Farel, for I have almost
given a pledge in your name to the brethren. It remains with
you, therefore, to fulfil the pledge, even though it were given
rashly. Moreover, because, from the present state of the kingdom,
it would be in vain to ask of the King what he ought to
do of his own accord, we have judged that he must at least be
required to undertake the commission of inquiry. This, again,
will be equivalent to interdicting the Parliaments from engaging
in it. In the next place, he must be asked to nominate extraordinary
impartial judges. If this is obtained, a great step will
be made. To aim at anything beyond this would, as I said, be
superfluous. If the Chancellor is disposed to favour us, all will
be well.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But as he is timid and tardy, we must see to it that
he is vigorously urged on. Accordingly, not less pains must
be taken in these secondary matters than in those of prime importance.
But abjuration is always to be expressly excluded;
for we do the work of Satan, if we open up a path to the godly
whereby they may be permitted to abjure Christ. I diligently
commend the whole matter, first to Master James Sturm, whose
authority in the conventions is of the highest order; in the next
place to Bucer, that he may stimulate those whom he can;
again to Sturm and Dr. Ulrich, that they may also interpose
the weight of their personal influence. The affair itself will
give you counsel. You are not, however, tyros. May the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
prosper his journey who shall undertake this sacred cause.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;Notwithstanding that the addition which you

had already heard somewhat thereof by Monsieur Dallein, and
Master Peter Viret has confirmed it to me. Beside that in
praying to God to look down with pity upon us in this strait,
we must look patiently for an outlet such as he shall please to
send; and whichsoever way he disposes thereof, that we may
be prepared to bear with it in suchwise that it must effectually
appear how obedient we are to him. Bethink yourself, also,
how by that wearisome sickness and so many relapses, our Lord
admonishes you, before the blow, so to strengthen you, that you
may not be taken by surprise, whatever may happen. However
the event may be, I do well believe that for all that, although
he may get the better of it, we must not count, neither
he nor myself, upon a long sojourning here below. And possibly
you also may very soon after follow us. But, after all,
I do not give up hope of more gladsome news.</p>

<p>To conclude, Madame, after having humbly commended me

<h3>Excitement caused at Geneva by the Representation of a Play.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>4th July 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>Our plays narrowly escaped being converted into tragedy.
When the senate had asked my opinion, I said that I would
make no reply unless concerning the common resolution of the
brethren. The brethren having been heard, I replied, that for
many reasons it did not seem to us expedient that the games
should be proceeded with, and at the same time I explained
the grounds of our opinion. I said, however, that we did not
wish to oppose them, if the senate held out for them. When
the day was coming on, Michael, (who had done so once before,)
instead of preaching, inveighed against the actors; but
so vehement was this second invective, that a concourse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
people straightway made towards me with loud shouts, threats,
and what not. And had I not by a strong effort restrained the
fury of some of them, they would have come to blows. I endeavoured
in the second discourse to appease their exasperation,
observing moderation, for I judged that he had acted imprudently
in having at an unseasonable time chosen such a theme
for declamation. But his extravagance was the more displeasing,
since I could by no means approve of what he had
said. He maintained it to be true; I firmly denied it. There
were some of the brethren who encouraged the man in his
obstinacy. About nine in the evening, I was told that a
hundred or thereabouts would meet on the following day in the
council-room. I immediately called the brethren together:
we came to the resolution that we ought to accompany Michael.
He was hardly suffered to go out along with me. I bring him
to the place of meeting; meanwhile I order the others to be
sent for. His accusers indicate their refusal to speak while we
are present; for they said they had no concern with me, beyond
that they regarded me with reverence, and were therefore
unwilling to enter into any dispute with me. I strenuously
insist that the cause is common, until it appear that Michael
has erred in his duty. We are ordered to withdraw to separate
sides of the house; from the opposite party arise seditious
shouts; they threateningly assert that they would have killed
Michael were it not that they revered me. To restrain the
tumult, he was detained in the council-room, but in a respectful
manner. On the following day, by the favour of the Lord,
we quieted all disturbances; for Abel,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> by the esteem in which
he is held, and I by my authority, prevailed with the actors.
The senate, however, was on our side. I was so far displeased
with it, that it was not more courageous and spirited, for as
usual it behaved too timidly; the result is, that the games are
now going on. Viret is present as a spectator, who has again
returned, according to arrangement, with a view to restore our
furious friend to sanity.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Of your brothers I hear absolutely nothing. There is with
you one Elie Limousin by name, a native of Rochelle, who
has now in a third letter asked me to certify to you what I
have known of his former life. Pious people who come from
that district declare that he was an upright man, and of honourable
life, and also that he was unmarried when he removed
thence to us. There is no reason, therefore, why any suspicion
of this nature should be a hindrance to his marriage. You
will apologize for my not having replied to him, and also for
having so cursorily gone over to you what perhaps demanded
a longer discourse. Adieu, dearest brother in the Lord, and
most sincere friend. Salute respectfully all the brethren;
there is no salutation from any one here to you or them, as no
one knew I was going to write except Nicolas, the father-in-law
of a brother, who came in. May the Lord be ever present
with you, and bless your sacred labours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;You see, by the date of the other letters,
what a length of time they have lain by me since they were
written, forasmuch as the bearer could not find means to fill his
letter-case; whereof I wished to inform you, fearing that you
might suppose that he had kept them up for such a length of
time in his own hands. We are in great anxiety for news concerning
you, on account of the rumour which is abroad. The
Lord graciously vouchsafe that you may have matter wherewith
to gladden us. Now, however, since the bearer has been tarrying
for a while, I have taken upon me, Monsieur, to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
request of you. You know that our brother Viret is about to
marry. I am in as great anxiety about it as himself. We
have plenty of wives here, both at Lausanne and at Orbe; but
yet there has not hitherto appeared a single one with whom I
should feel at all satisfied. While we have this matter in
hand, I would beseech you earnestly, if you have remarked
any one in your quarter who appears to you likely to suit him,
that you would please let me know of it. I have not thought
fit to apply to any other than yourself, seeing that every one
has not the prudence which is herein required. You may
reply to me, that I am at least acquainted with some one in
your neighbourhood; but I shall not venture to breathe a
word before having your opinion, which you can tell me in
one word, for I shall hold your silence for a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non placet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> I
have not felt the least difficulty in addressing you privately
in regard to this, although the subject may be rather delicate,
for the necessity of the case would excuse me, were I even
somewhat importunate, because there was no one else in whom
it appeared safe to confide; and I am well aware that, for your
part, knowing of how much consequence the marriage of such
a man is for the Church of God, you would not spare yourself
any pains therein. Indeed, I would not hinder your acting
directly for him, supposing that a suitable party can be found
there; but in regard to asking advice, I have taken for granted
that you will allow me that liberty.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Monseigneur, after having commended me to
your kind favour with such affection as that wherewith I love
you, I pray our good Lord to have always a care of you, guiding
you in suchwise that you may be more and more serviceable
for the advancement of his glory.</p>

<p>Think of what you are going to do, and then write to me

the more numerous and the better are the testimonies with
which the young lady is honoured. Accordingly, I am now
seeking to discover the mind of her father. As soon as we
have reached any certainty, I will let you know. Meanwhile,
do you make yourself ready. This match does not please
Perrin, because he wishes to force upon you the daughter of
Rameau. That makes me the more solicitous about pre-occupying
the ground in good time, lest we be obstructed by having
to make excuses. To-day, as far as I gather, he will enter
upon the subject with me, for we are both invited by Corna to
supper. I will gain time by a civil excuse. It would tend to
promote the matter if I, with your permission, should ask her.
I have seen her twice; she is very modest, with an exceedingly
becoming countenance and person. Of her manners, all speak

<h3>Fresh details regarding the projects for his marriage.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>15th July 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>Three days ago, towards the conclusion of supper, mention
was made of your marriage, which I had foretold you would
be the case. But Dominic Arlot, whose assistance I had employed,
presently interrupted the conversation; for he said that
the matter was completed. On hearing this our friend instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sprung up from table, and, in his usual way, gave reins
to his indignation; for, says he, his whole body shaking, "Will
he then marry that girl of low connections? Could there not
be found for him in the city one of better family? Whoever
have been the originators or abettors of this business, I regard
them as vile and infamous. Of a brother and sister I am thus
unwillingly compelled to speak." I, in reply, say, "I could
not be the originator of it, inasmuch as the young lady was
unknown to me. I acknowledge that I was a promoter of it,
and, indeed, the principal one; but that the matter is finally
settled, as Dominic has asserted, is not true, beyond this, that
I have gone so far in it that to draw back would be dishonourable.
In that there is nothing for me to be ashamed of." His
fury was thus turned into laughter. But he again began to grow
hot, because the matter had been concealed from him by you.
He was especially inflamed with a foolish jealousy, because
Corna confessed that you and he, while riding, had talked over
the thing together. "Is it even so?" he proceeded to say to
Corna. "Was it for this I attended him along with you, that
he might in the most insulting manner shut out from his
counsels the most attached friend he has in the world? [for] I
would cheerfully prefer him to myself."</p>

<p>I objected that he himself drew a false conclusion, since you
had not disclosed your mind even to Farel. He was, therefore,
again pacified, though he talked of the daughter of Rameau,
whom he extolled in an extraordinary manner. I nodded assent
to all the encomiums, that I might remain firm in regard
to the other party.</p>

<p>Consider, now, whether it be expedient for you to come into
the city disengaged. For there will be a hateful apologizing,
if they proceed to obtrude her upon you. I know how dangerous
even it may be to give a promise before the natural disposition
of the girl has been ascertained. I am full of anxiety,
nor can I easily clear a way for myself. I think, however, that
this course would not be ridiculous. Suppose you consent to
my asking the young lady in your name, the condition being
added, that before the betrothal takes place, you are to meet her,
that we may give some certain promise. They will thus not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
dare to press you. Write in return, therefore, by the earliest
possible messenger what your views are, although, at the same
time, I give it as my advice that you should not delay long,
but come on an early day. Of the lady, I hear nothing that is
not highly pleasing. In her father and mother, also, there is
nothing blamable. I am the more confirmed, when I see that
our opponents have nothing to carp at beyond this, that it was
impossible for them to frighten us from our purpose. There
are some things about the daughter of Rameau which I fear;
nevertheless, as it is your own affair, you will be free to choose.
I will never, however, allow that there is any man on earth
who has greater concern about his own matters than I have
about the present.</p>

<p>This youth came to us from Italy, with the view of giving
his attention to sacred literature, if a situation had been found
such as he had hoped for. But as he has been disappointed,
he wished, before he returned home, to pay you a visit. I have
observed in him a truly good disposition. You will say a few
words to confirm him in the fear of the Lord, and in reverence
for his teaching.&mdash;Adieu. May the Lord direct you by his
counsel, and bless you in a recommendation of so much moment.
Salute respectfully all the brethren.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>Forgive me for not having, some time ago, sent to you this
letter by our treasurer&mdash;I mean Bucer's, for, as the messenger
brought it open, I thought that it had been already read by you
and Farel. Afterwards, he reminded me that not even Toussain
had read it. You will therefore send it to Farel, as soon as
you shall have an opportunity. I am surprised that Bucer
was not aroused by the murderous outrage so greatly to be
execrated, which the Emperor perpetrated when he struck off
the heads of the principal senators at Ratisbon. I am also surprised
that he has made no mention of the incendiaries, but I
set it down partly to his engagements. The other matter he
has perhaps passed over on purpose, because he did not dare
to commit everything to writing in these dubious times.</p>

<p>What I wrote to you, by the treasurer, regarding the settlement
of the matter, was told to me by Peter Ursier, whom I
was then employing as negotiator; because I was unwilling to
say anything myself, until I had received a more definite commission.
But after reading your letter, I waited on the father
and daughter, that I might be absolutely certain of success. As
soon, however, as reference was made to a change of residence,
the father took exception to it, on the ground that something
different had been promised him. I said that no promise to
that effect had been made with our knowledge; and, moreover,
that I had carefully enjoined Peter Ursier not to cajole them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
such promises. I pointed out how absurd it would be if we
were to leave our churches to follow whither our wives called
us; that a marriage consummated under such a condition
would be an unhappy, because an unholy, alliance, that would
not pass without punishment falling on both you and the girl;
finally, that you would never be prevailed upon to afford the
first example of so disgraceful a practice, and, therefore, that it
was in vain to make the request. I added, that Lausanne was
not so far distant from this as to prevent his daughter from
being with him as often as might be necessary; that it would,
likewise, be more satisfactory to have daily to congratulate his
absent daughter than constantly to see and hear her weeping
and bewailing the cruelties of her husband, which he observed
was the case with so many. He requested space for deliberation,
and, at the end of three days, he replied, that he was unwilling
to send his only daughter from home. I felt greatly
indignant at being so deluded by the folly of those in whom
I trusted. I restrained myself, however, and dissembled my
anger. But I do not need to offer any more lengthened excuse
to you, as I am free from all blame. We may accordingly
turn to some other quarter. Christopher spoke to me of a
certain widow, who, he asserts, pleases him admirably. If
such is the case, I am at rest, and leave it. But if not, indicate
your mind. We shall very shortly, also, have a messenger
from Strasbourg.&mdash;Adieu, brother, and most sincere friend.
Salute all the co-presbyters very affectionately. May the Lord
preserve you all safe, and direct you by his Holy Spirit even
to the end.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Violence of the family of Amy Perrin&mdash;declamations of the wife of Froment against
the ministers of Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, [<i>1st September 1546.</i>]
</p>

<p>Although the letter was not in every respect to my mind, for
I was afraid that its undue harshness might hurt so delicate a
stomach, I took care to have it forwarded, but in such a way
that he should not know that I had seen it.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> For this person
conveyed it to his house as if it had been intrusted by you to
himself. Should he thunder after his peculiar fashion, his bolts
will die away in mere clatter. I not only appear before him,
but almost obtrude myself upon him; only, I observe a mean,
that I may keep in mind the place I hold; nor is this done on
my own account, but because the man, being accustomed to
adulation, would abuse my modesty, to the derision of Christ.
I therefore despair of him, unless God apply a remedy. His wife
is an unnatural fury. The widow N. is so shamelessly wanton,
that you would say she is quite youthful. Then, having an evil
conscience, she is excited by every word that is spoken before
the congregation, and discharges upon us at home the venom
she harbours. She has manifested towards you, however, marvellous
good-will; for she took to her house your two nephews,
when they were dangerously ill, and treats them as her own
sons. This kind office deserves a liberal meed of thanks,
which you will not omit to convey to her, whenever a messenger
shall present himself. She is so opposed to all of us, that I
believe Cæsar<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> himself is not more of an enemy; and yet, I
confess I do not know what cause is to be assigned for this, unless
that she shamelessly undertakes the defence of all her crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>I am now going to give you a humorous story. The wife of
Froment<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> lately came to this place. She declaimed through all
the shops, and at almost all the cross-roads, against long garments.
When she knew that I was aware of it, she excused
herself by alleging that she had said with a smile, that we were
either unbecomingly clothed, to the great detriment of the
Church, or that you taught what was erroneous, when you said
that false prophets could be distinguished by their long vestments.
When I was rebutting so stale a calumny, she began to
ascribe even to the Holy Spirit what she had directed against us.
What is the meaning, said she, of that passage of the Gospel,
"They will come to you in long garments?" I replied, that I
did not know where that sentence was to be found, unless, perhaps,
it might occur in the gospel of the Manichæans; for the
passage of Luke xx. 45, is as follows: "Beware of the Scribes,
who desire to walk in long robes," but not, "They will come to
you," &amp;c., which she had interpolated from Matthew vii. [15.]
Feeling that she was closely pressed, she complained of our
tyranny, because there was not a general license of prating
about everything. I dealt with the woman as I should have
done. She immediately proceeded to the widow of Michael,
who gave her a hospitable reception, sharing with her not only
her table, but her bed, because she maligned the ministers. I
leave these wounds untouched, because they appear to me incurable
until the Lord apply his hand. We are to celebrate
the Supper on the next Lord's-day. You may thus form a
judgment of the straits by which I am encompassed. Would
that it could be celebrated without me, even on condition that
I should creep to you on my hands! I wish that the verse of
Terence would occur to your brothers, "To lose in time is to
make gain." I have admonished them, but they do not make
the haste I wished. They may bear, however, for a short time
the delay that has taken place, although it is disagreeable to
us.&mdash;Adieu, brother and most sincere friend. Salute respectfully,
in my name, all the brethren, your family, and the godly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
citizens. May the Lord preserve you, and always direct you
by his Spirit! Amen.</p>

<h3>Calvin's indisposition&mdash;literary labours&mdash;apparent reconciliation with Perrin and his
family.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>2d October 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>Not to beguile you by a vain hope, I may say that I do not
think I shall come to your place before winter; for having once
experienced the inconvenience of a voyage, I shall not venture
again to commit myself to the waters. A good part of the
journey would thus fall to be accomplished on foot, for the jolting
of a horse is not only hurtful to me, but the rubbing also is
dangerous. I am not acquainted with the physician of whom
you speak, nor do I rightly understand what druggist you blame,
unless, as I conjecture, you hint at Francis. What Textor may
now think I do not know, except that he was too stringent in his
prescriptions. For by involving himself in the lawsuits of his
father, he has woven, in his native place, a Penelope's web that
will have no end. Meanwhile, you see him complaining that
he was deprived of my advice. But this peevishness of the
good man must somehow or other be tolerated by us. As you
exhort me to write, I wish I had more leisure occasionally, and
more robust health. I have now, however, set myself in earnest
to the Epistle to the Galatians.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> I am not free in the matter of
publication, as far at least as the Epistles of Paul are concerned.
You once heard from me when I was at Strasbourg, that Wendelin
laid me under obligations by services of such a nature, that
I should be constrained to charge myself with ingratitude unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I offered this work to him. For at the time of my greatest
straits, he expended on my behalf above forty golden pieces,
and he was not less prompt in his assistance in taking charge
of my domestic affairs, than if I had hired him for the express
purpose of superintending them. I am, therefore, now not at
liberty to refuse him the Epistles. If I should write anything
else, it will rather be published here, and yet Des Gallars could
find no one to undertake to bring out two short treatises he had
composed. Before, however, I subject my writings to any risk,
I shall retain a copy. I left off for a time a short treatise, <cite>De
Scandalis</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> that I had begun, because the style did not flow so
freely as I wished, nor have I a mind to resume it, until I shall
have completed the Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians.
I had lately some conversation with our friend Perrin.
If he perform what he promised, matters will not be at the very
worst.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Penthesilæa, while in her outward deportment she
affects a wonderful friendship, rages within doors in a terrible
manner. I observe that you have written to her. I shall call
for her on the earliest opportunity. I shall then discover what
effect your letter has had.&mdash;Adieu, brother and most sincere
friend. May the Lord be ever present with you, always protect
you, and render your labours prosperous! I wrote to the ministers
of Berne. If you desire to know the contents of the letter
Viret, I think, retained a copy. My wife reverently salutes you,
as also Des Gallars, Feron, my brother, (for since I received
yours I have not seen the others.) The best greeting to the
brethren and friends, and to your whole family.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>I had no talk with Perrin about your letter. I was unwilling
to touch that sore, until it should have been somewhat mollified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by the lapse of time. If there is any news, provided it be

<h3>Recurrence to the matrimonial projects of Viret&mdash;explanations on various subjects.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 4th of October 1546</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;While hour after hour I was on the lookout
for James on his return from Lyons, to reply to you by him, I
was amazed the other day when my brother told me that he had
passed through without speaking with me. And now it happens
that I must write you very much in haste, because of the sudden
departure of the bearer. It is very true I was told of it
yesterday, but it was at eight o'clock at night, when my megrim
troubled me so severely, that it was with great pain I could
open my mouth. This morning I thought that he would be
gone away, until at the end of the sermon, he told me that he
would wait a quarter of an hour to oblige me; wherefore, I
must beg of you to excuse the brevity.</p>

<p>As to the affair of the individual for whose sake I have made
the request, he has replied to me, thanking you very humbly
for the kind affection you have shewn him; that he would
desire above all things to have communication with the party,
fearing lest, from the want of a mutual understanding, they
might not assort so well together in future. Besides, while
these troubles last, it appeared to him that the journey could
not be well undertaken, and I am much of that opinion; for
thereby there would be some danger of a long protraction of the
affair, and this is by no means your intention, which I find very
reasonable. As for the rest, there is no sort of hindrance arising
from health; but I find this to be an annoyance, that a matter,
uncertain at any rate, should be kept for so long in suspense,
although I do not find fault with his request, considering the
reasons which he has alleged to me for it, that it is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that the wife he shall take may be informed beforehand of
some domestic charges which he is obliged to bear. Besides,
love requires previous acquaintance, and the household affairs
never go on well without a private mutual understanding, and
a settlement of the conditions required on both sides. The
mischief is, the waiting for that length of time; and besides,
I do not see any great object to be gained by it. I pray God
that, in any event, he would well order it.</p>

<p>About the book,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> it strikes me that I have told you enough
already of what occurred to me, and therefore I do not comprehend
wherefore you ask my opinion anew, unless it might be
to shew it to him. Besides, he will take it better, methinks,
if it may please you, to shew him the passage of my letter on
that point, the more that I speak therein more freely, not knowing
the author. Nevertheless, if it appears to you that there
is somewhat more to be said, when you shall please to inform
me of it, I will follow your advice.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Antony Maillet has written to me, that he had
spoken to Peter Telsen, and tells me that the twelve crowns
which Master Valerand has disbursed, are to be refunded to
you, although I need not be in very much haste about it,
but suit my own convenience. I know not whether he has done
so by mistake, but if he has still twelve crowns to pay, Peter
Telsen must have laid out twice as much as he ought; for I
have sent you twelve crowns by my brother, the which you have
told me you had received. Notwithstanding, if Peter Telsen
have failed to do so, I would not that you should be the loser,
albeit I know not for what purpose he can have employed the
money; but as to that, it will be my business to settle with him.
Before saying a word about it, I was desirous to know the truth.
I pray you, then, that you may please let me know whether,
besides the twelve crowns which my brother returned to you,
there has a still further sum of like amount gone out of your
purse. Seeing that they have roused so much indignation
down there, I see not what hinders you to publish your <cite>Apology</cite>,
and it seems to me very fit that you do so. Nevertheless, I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
what I think about it without prejudice. The rest remains
still in the pen, for the bearer has not given me a long enough
time. And thus, Monseigneur, after commending me humbly
to your kind favour and that of Madame, I pray our good
Lord to have you always in his keeping, vouchsafing you grace
in suchwise ever to walk, that he may be ever more and more
glorified in you. I render thanks to him for that he hath set
you up again, but I beseech of him to increase you in strength
daily, until you are completely restored. My wife presents
her humble commendations.</p>

<h3>Sad communication to be made to M. de Falais&mdash;promise to send several discourses.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 19th of October</i> [1546.]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;Forasmuch as you informed me by your last,
that you sent me therewith the letter of Monsieur de Fresne, I
feared that the bearer had not done his duty in taking proper
care of what had been committed to him. But he has assured
me that he had received nothing else but what he has delivered
to me. Wherefore, I guess that it has been left behind by neglect.
I believe that your intention in sending it to me, was
in order to have my advice how to inform Monsieur of it.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Now, as he must be made aware of the news, I could have no
hesitation in opening up somewhat of the business, whenever
he shall be in a good humour, and then telling him all about
it. Except when he is ailing, he is not a man that lets himself
be overcome by sadness, and who does not know how to
make a profitable improvement of the grace which God vouchsafes
him for his consolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>He has put me in mind that you were complaining lately of
Monsieur enjoying himself all alone in the reading of my Commentary.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
You request me also to have some thought of those
who only understand French, that they also may partake, and
you ask for my sermons. Well, if there had been a demand for
putting them forth, I would indeed have set about it in good
earnest; but that will not be this year. However, if God
bestow grace to finish the Epistle to the Galatians, which ought
to be summary, I have the framework of something of a treatise
which shall speak French as well as Latin, that may prove
somewhat useful, as I hope.</p>

<p>After having affectionately commended me to your kind
favour, and presented the humble salutations of my wife, I
beseech our good Lord to have you in his safeguard, making
you more and more serviceable for the advancement of his
kingdom.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 19th of October 1546</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I believe that you have received my last
letter, by which you will have understood that yours had been
delivered by Alexander, but somewhat tardily. I give thanks
to our good Lord affectionately for the news which Madame
has communicated to me of the recovery of your health. I
hope that it may please Him, who has begun so well, that in
the spring you will feel yourself so nimble that you will not
know how to restrain your merriment, so as to make up for
past time. We shall look for that, and for all else, as it shall
please him of his infinite goodness to allot, having good expectance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that the rage which the Court of <em>Malines</em> has vented
upon you will pass off in smoke.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>I believe that it will soon be time to sound a retreat for both
camps.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> I pray God so to direct the whole that the upshot may
prove for the advancement of his own honour. I am better
pleased that he makes war upon that unhappy tyrant with
his own hand, than otherwise. For if we were to attempt anything
of importance, I should always fear the fatal consequences
of the presumption. We have never yet heard what has become
of that harebrained fellow, the Count de Buren,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> whether
he has passed on with his army, or whether he has been driven
back. Howsoever it may be, <em>it is not the multitude nor the arm
of flesh that can prevail</em>.</p>

<p>Master Valerand is returning; you shall know better from
him the whole state of your affairs. Howbeit, I see no other
means, unless you yield somewhat on your side, until God
opens up a better. You will know who this bearer is, and his
purpose in going to you. Because I believed his determination
to be right, I have not desired to turn him back from it.</p>

<p>To conclude, Monseigneur, after my humble commendation
to your kind favour, I shall pray our good Lord to have ever
his hand stretched out to guide you by his grace.</p>

<h3>Excuses for Viret&mdash;uses of sickness&mdash;various rumours concerning the war in Germany&mdash;explanations
on the subject of the Supper.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 16th of November 1546</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Although I was expecting a letter from you
from day to day, I could not let this messenger go away without
writing, to make some reply to your last. I shall begin upon
the subject of the little book which you sent me. Having
read my answer, and the opinion I had of it, you have mentioned
to me the name of the author; and because he is somewhat
opinionative, you request me to let you know my mind
about it, in order that you may tell him on his return the
opinion you have formed. Your words are these, "The author
is Denis de la Roche, who has requested of me that I would
send it you privately. In consequence of this I feel puzzled
how to set about finding fault, for I fear he will suspect that
the criticism comes from you, and he is a little proud, and
withal tenacious of his own views. Inasmuch as you have
known him longer than I, write me your advice, so that upon
his return I may be able to tell him the judgment which I
have come to, when he shall ask me for it."</p>

<p>You must hold me excused in this matter. I know not how
to proceed therein, since I have already shortly stated to you
my opinion in regard to it. If you ask me for a lengthened
discussion, I could not do it so well as when it was fresh in my
recollection; and indeed I have doubtless forgotten part of
what I formerly wrote. What made me doubtful as to your
drift, was that it seemed to me you were asking me to do over
again what I had already done. And even now I do not comprehend
wherefore you would have a new declaration of my
opinion, unless you were dissatisfied with the first. It would
be very difficult for me to discuss in detail the things which
have escaped me. For I have retained but a confused idea of
the general argument, and of some points here and there.</p>

<p>As concerns the marriage in reference to which I have put you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in requisition,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> I beseech you, Monseigneur, to believe what I
shall tell you, for I shall recount the pure truth without any
dissimulation whatever. The reason which induced me to write
you about it was, that a party had been proposed here who
was no wise suitable for him. But on account of the forwardness
of some of those who had meddled in the affair, we had very
great difficulty in getting the proposal set aside. And so, to
break the blow, it was my earnest desire to have found some
one in another quarter; for there would have been less envy
and jealousy had he taken one from a distance, as we have
already had ample experience in the murmurs which some have
made when we would not follow their leading-string. I assure
you, however, that he has not been making indirect application
elsewhere. But without reference either to her whom you kindly
named in your reply, nor yet to any other, I have thought it
advisable, under the circumstances of the case, to recommend
the man to you. Then you know the first letter loitered long
upon the way, before we had any news from you, which was
the occasion of my writing again, and that at his own instance,
although I did not comprehend very clearly why. For in the
meantime, from what I have since learnt, he had a proposition
from another quarter. Nevertheless, after receiving tidings
from you, I communicated with himself, and the result was
such as I have told you, without feigned civility or double-dealing.
Since then, I have understood that the proposal about
a widow was still under consideration, although to this hour I
know not how it stands. And so far was I from meddling,
that knowing in this town of a widow as well endowed as I
could have wished for myself if God had so far afflicted me as
to have deprived me of my helpmate,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and that there was a necessity
for my marrying again; on considering the other proposals
which were under consideration, I have not felt inclined
to bring forward her name. And notwithstanding, I have no
doubt whatever that it would prove an admirable match for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
But all the more that I refrained from active friendly interference,
it was sufficient for me to commit him to God, and
to let the stream find its own channel. You see how I have
thanked you without hypocrisy, now that I have set before you
the difficulties that I have had here. And I do not think that
there was any want of honesty in the man for whom I spoke;
indeed I might venture to assure you of it. But purposes
change in a few hours. Seeing the present position of matters,
I did not like to communicate to him anything of what was
contained in your letter. I shall not trouble you with long
excuses; and besides, it is well that the thing has not taken
wind. Wherefore, if you think fit, consider the whole matter
as if it had never been mooted. Meanwhile, your goodwill
toward me must not be buried out of mind, nor toward the
man who is principally concerned in the affair. For I assure
you that he was truly grateful for your interference, and I
know that he has it imprinted on his heart, although it was
attended with no result.</p>

<p>With regard to the money which has been laid out on account
of our child, that you may not be further troubled about it,
Antony Maillet will settle the amount. And now, please God, I
shall do my duty, thanking you most affectionately that you have
been pleased to have patience until the settlement could be made.</p>

<p>Since the <cite>Apology</cite> has not yet gone forth, it is very desirable
to have the news which Master Valeran<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> may bring along with
him. And, indeed, over and above the circumstance which
has befallen in your particular case, the general declaration
which the man has made against the whole cause, well deserves
that the style should be altered, and that some additions be
interwoven. And seeing that God has allowed you to wait so
long, he will so end all as to instruct you the more certainly.</p>

<p>Although I have indeed heard of a man having been seized
at Berne for poisoning and fire-raising, nevertheless, I have so
little correspondence in that quarter, that I have heard nothing
of it but upon common report. On which account I did not care
to say much to you about it. If it be really so as has been related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to you, I must acknowledge that it is a good thing that
God is more concerned about my life than are my neighbours.</p>

<p>Although your weakness may be protracted, it is much that
you go on steadily, though by slow degrees, in the way of
amendment. And when I consider the complaint, I feel that
there is still greater reason to be well content. Notwithstanding,
we shall not give over praying to God that it would please
him to confirm you entirely, with thanksgiving that he has
brought you back from the brink of the grave. Besides, I
hope, from present appearances, that he is minded yet to make
use of you in health, since he has employed you in sickness.
For although laid powerless upon a bed, we are by no means
useless to him, if we testify our obedience by resigning ourselves
to his good pleasure,&mdash;if we give proof of our faith by
resisting temptation,&mdash;if we take advantage of the consolation
which he gives us in order to overcome the troubles of the
flesh. It is in sickness, especially when prolonged, that patience
is most needful; but most of all in death. Nevertheless, as I
have said, I confide in this good God, that after having exercised
you by sickness he will still employ your health to some
good purpose. Meanwhile, we must beseech him that he
would uphold us in steadfast courage, never permitting us to
fall away because of lengthened on-waiting.</p>

<p>Howsoever doubtful the retreat of Renard<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> may be, it is
nevertheless no small matter, that instead of reaching the
point aimed at, which would have been his great advantage, he
has made a crablike movement backwards. And from what
we have heard, he has left behind the marks of the persecution
of God's hand. I am much better pleased that God should cut
off his finger than we his arm. Not that that is not still God's
work, which he performs by us, but I always fear so much the
effect of glory, that I rejoice the more when it is plainly the
doing of the Lord. And the unhappy man has likewise still
greater occasion to feel uneasiness at heart. Whatever may
come of it, I think that I have only spoken the truth, after the
news of his departure, in writing what follows:&mdash;Whither is
he going? Whither is he gone? What will become of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wicked man?&mdash;By thus driving him away, God has at least
lowered his pride.</p>

<p>A report is afloat, which troubles and plagues more than
it astonishes me. It is that Maurice has entered into an understanding
with him to ruin his own cousin and his father-in-law,
and in the end to ruin himself;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for Satan must assuredly have
got entire possession of him. We shall await, however, whatsoever
shall please God, prepared to accept all that shall please him.</p>

<p>Concerning the advice which you require of me, whether it
were expedient to refresh the memory of the ambassadors: before
I had an opportunity of writing to you, the time to do so had gone
by; I therefore rather held my peace, not so much from forgetfulness
as from this consideration: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne pluvia post messem</i>.</p>

<p>There is one point, however, that I think I have forgotten,
namely, the complaint they make, that it appears I would
shut up the body in the bread alone. I know not where they
have dreamed that dream. In several treatises I speak of that
matter, but chiefly in the <cite>Institution</cite>, in the <cite>Catechism</cite>, in the
<cite>Commentary on Corinthians</cite>, and in the manner of administration
of the Lord's Supper. In the <cite>Supplication</cite> I have only
touched upon it very lightly. Besides that, I have written a
little book upon the subject, in which I believe a reader of sound
judgment will meet with nothing to find fault with. But here
is their mistake: many think that we make no distinction between
the sign and the truth signified, unless we separate them
entirely, to make God like a mountebank, who exhibits delusive
representations by sleight of hand. It is our duty, however, to
proclaim, that this comes by the craft of Satan, who only seeks
to bewilder the understanding, that he may render our labours
of no avail. Let us therefore pray to God that he would bestow
increase by his grace, so that our labour may not be in vain.
Such examples ought to incite us thereto, and likewise to admonish
us, not to think that we have done some great thing
by merely having written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur, having presented the humble commendations of
myself, as well as of my wife, to your kind favour, and also
that of Madame, I pray our good Lord, that it would please
him ever to preserve you in his holy protection, strengthening
you in all might by his Spirit, making his glory to shine forth
in you ever more and more.</p>

<p>I beg to be excused for faults, for I have not been able to
revise the present letter, being engrossed by headache with
which I have been seized. Our friend and brother, Des Gallars,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
also humbly commends himself to you, and sends you a distich
which he has composed upon Renard. We greatly desire to
have some news. If the war did not give holiday to the printing-presses,
I would have sent Vendelin the <cite>Galatians</cite>; but
since the <cite>Corinthians</cite> lie quiet in his desk, there is no need for
my being in any hurry.</p>

<h3>Consolations on the death of his sister.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 20th of November 1546</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;The day before Camus arrived, I had written
to you, as well as to others, by a young tailor of Picardy; but
because I was not certain whether they had as yet informed
you of the death of Madame your sister,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> I did not venture to
mention it. Now I have rejoiced, and have thanked God
with my whole heart, perceiving by the letter of Madame that
you had at once taken your stand upon the point whereon I
would have founded my principal argument, if I had wished to
console you. And, indeed, you have much occasion for gratitude
on account of the grace which God has vouchsafed to her,
and to you also. For seeing that her husband had waxed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cold, the good lady would have been in an unhappy captivity
had she remained longer in the world, and would only have
languished her life away. On your part, you would not have
had it in your power to lend her a helping hand, nor to solace
her sorrows; and so you never could have thought of her without
regret and vexation. God, therefore, has had pity upon you
and her, in thus providing, and above all, in preventing the
dangers into which she might have fallen in a long career, by
reason of the frailty which is in us. And we have yet a better
ground of further consolation, that it will not be long ere we
find ourselves together again. Meanwhile, let us think of preparing
ourselves to follow her, for the time will soon come. But
I like much better to congratulate you, seeing that our Lord has
already put these things in your heart, than to labour in recalling
them to your memory. The other news which Camus has
told me about you, has also cheered me to await the time when
God will bring to pass what he has put into so good a train.</p>

<p>Monseigneur, after humble commendations to your kind
favour, and having presented the humble remembrances of my
wife, I pray our good Lord to have you ever in his safeguard,
to strengthen you in body and in spirit, so as always to make
you more abound in his service.</p>

your kind favour.</p>

<h3>Assurances of affection for herself and her husband.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 20th of November 1546</i>.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;Having been made aware that Monseigneur had
been informed of the death of his sister, I have only given him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one word on the subject, knowing beforehand from yourself
that he has no need of long consolation, seeing that God, without
human means, has put into his heart that which cannot
fail to alleviate his sadness.</p>

<p>As for my promise, to which you hold me bound, I shall discharge
myself of it, when God shall have vouchsafed me the
means wherewith to do so. But I am astonished that you
should even hint at the reward which my said Lord intends for
me, as if I were looking to that, and had not other considerations
in the discharge of my duty to him. The love and reverence
which I may well bear toward him in our Lord are
so strong, that I am very sorry that I cannot devote myself
more to his and your service, to shew what is in my heart.
Howbeit, I beseech you not to take amiss what I have now
said, for I have had no other feeling than the fear that you
may not place such reliance upon me as I desire. Besides, I
do not mean to make any complaint which deserves a reply;
for it is quite enough for me that you have neither entertained
a doubt nor a suspicion which has induced you to mention it.</p>

<p>Now therefore I shall make an end, after having humbly
commended me to your kind favour. I pray our good Lord
to have you always in his holy protection, guiding and governing
you after his own good will, so as to glorify his holy name
in you.</p>

<h3>Statement of the expense of a visit to Lausanne, on the occasion of Viret's marriage&mdash;ecclesiastical
difficulties at Berne.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>3d Dec. 1546</i>.
</p>

<p>Two letters of Bucer were delivered to me after a short interval.
I send both of them to you, although they may contain
almost nothing which you have not learned from other sources.
With regard to the King of France, I think that he will shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
be brought to give some assistance with money to our party&mdash;the
only thing that is sought from him. It is, moreover, in
the highest degree, his interest to distract the attention of
Charles by another war.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> I have enjoined Peter Textor to pay
to you sixteen crowns; for although I had ten with me when
I came to the marriage, it escaped my memory. But here is a
greater lapse of memory; when I had found them laid aside in
my desk, I stood still for some time, not knowing whether I had
ever seen them before. Raymond came upon me, who reminded
me of the fact, that he had given them to me by order of
Antony Maillet. You will therefore add this sum to the former.
In the other six [crowns,] I am afraid that I have made a mistake;
for they may possibly belong to my brother. For as a
teacher of Orleans was in his debt, he arranged that payment
should be made by the son of Bruno. He had lately received
five [crowns.] You will therefore retain these until I shall
have learned with certainty from Saint André, whether they
ought to be given to you or to my brother.</p>

<p>Sulzer lately wrote to me that matters had reached an extremity.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
He implores our aid. I consulted with the brethren.
As we could discover no plan of procedure in circumstances so
perplexed, and almost desperate, I repaired to Nyon. I became
aware that they had committed much more grievous errors
than the letters contain any mention of. They are not, in my
opinion, fighting for a cause that is good in every respect. All
see that their proceedings are preposterous; and yet when we
also see that everything is going to ruin, with what conscience
shall we be silent? I asked Nicolas,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> whether he thought
that a letter from us would be of any service? He gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
trembling and hesitating consent to our writing. Should a
messenger present himself in good time, I wish that you also
would intimate your opinion; thereafter consider whether it
be not time to press for obtaining a Synod.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother, and most sincere friend, along with your
wife, whom you will respectfully salute in the name of all ours,
as well as James and the rest.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Military movements in Switzerland&mdash;policy of the Cantons in reference to the Emperor.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 8th of December 1546</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I have nothing to write you at present,
except that we are waiting to see what will be done by the
Swiss.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> All is in readiness at Berne as if to start at any
moment, the captain, his council, officers, soldiers, chosen and
commissioned; a second order sent, to be ready to march, with
artillery and baggage. Their army consists of ten thousand
men. I believe they would not have delayed so long, if there
had not been an impediment which holds them as it were tied
by the leg. For it is now about a year since all the cantons
agreed that none should leave the country to engage in war,
without the consent of the rest. Now there is fear that the
Papists may be urged to invade the country while it is depopulated,
under colour of breach of treaty; which if the King
of France had only thrown in a word, would have happened a
long time ago,&mdash;namely, had he called the Papists to enter his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
service, which ours would have readily agreed to do. Thus
would the one side have spoken German to Charles, the others
Italian or Picard.</p>

<p>I fear indeed that there must be a want of good management
as well in that as in other things. Thereby are we so much the
more admonished to pray God that he by his infinite goodness
would be pleased to supply so many shortcomings. True
it is, that the ignorant are apt to judge foolishly. But however
that may be, every one is amazed that they are so long
&mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> without putting forth an effort. For it looks as if
God were holding out the hand to us, as much as to say&mdash;enter
in. And in letting the time slip by, we only invigorate <em>him</em>
who is already almost desperate. Let us pray, therefore, and
seeing that it pleases God to make trial of our patience for our
good, let us be content with what he sends us, never growing
weary of serving him, on any account whatsoever.</p>

<p>There has been murmuring of late on account of some appointment.
They would indeed need wondrous masons to
complete the building. But I fear that our people, or some of
them at least, may let themselves be so far led away as to entertain
the proposals, which would be to replace the enemy,
not only in the exercise of his former tyrannous sway, but even
of that to which he has always aspired. Yet, inasmuch as I
feel assured that it will not so happen unless God shall be altogether
exasperated against us, I trust that he will avert so
great a danger. For I have no doubt that he looks rather
upon his own work in us, than upon our sins and shortcomings,
that he may have pity on us.</p>

<p>And now, Monseigneur, having humbly commended me to
your good favour, and that of Madame; having also presented
the commendations of my wife, and of our neighbours, I pray
God of his goodness to keep you always in his protection, and
to make you feel more and more the joy of his help.</p>

<p>Your servant and humble brother and ever bounden friend,</p>

<h2>CLXXXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Madame de Budé.</span><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></h2>

<h3>Calvin exhorts this lady to leave France, and retire with her family to Geneva.</h3>

<p class="sig">
<i>This 20th .... 1546.</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;Howbeit that I have occasion to praise God for
the great zeal and constancy he has vouchsafed to you, as I
have heard from the bearer, yet, believing that my exhortation
might not be superfluous to you, in the midst of such diversified
trials and conflicts, I was unwilling to forego writing you some
words by him, and, above all, to help you to come to a determination
upon the point on which you are still somewhat
doubtful; that is, as to your retiring hitherward that you may
serve God in peace of conscience. Were it possible for you to
discharge your duty where you are, I would by no means advise
you to stir. But I am well aware in what captivity you are
held. If God had given you strength and constancy to prepare
for death, and not to flinch for any fear of the danger wherein
you are, there would be nothing better than to keep that grace in
exercise. But if you feel that the weakness of the flesh gets
the mastery, and hinders you from doing your duty, seeing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
your conscience must needs be troubled and in continual torment,
the only way is to seek a suitable remedy. For it is no
slight perplexity, yea, even agony, to feel ourselves blamable
in a matter of so great moment; yea, and that the evil continues
to such an extent, that we can make no end of offending
God. Although many deceive themselves in this matter,
making themselves believe that it is but a trifling fault to defile
themselves with superstitions which are repugnant to the word
of God, and derogate from his honour, I reckon that his honour,
to whom we owe everything, is so precious to you, that
it is felt to be a subject of intolerable regret to you to offend
against it daily, as you are constrained to do at present. I do
not doubt, therefore, but that you have a special desire to
escape out of such wretchedness, and that until you do, you
cannot but be in very great anxiety and sadness. Consider,
now, whether this is not an unhappy condition, thus to linger
for ever. I know, indeed, that there are many who reply to
us, that we here are no more angels than themselves, and that
we offend God even as they do; which is true. But as the
proverb says, "Sickness upon sickness is not health." If,
then, we come far short in other respects, what need is there
to increase our condemnation by adding to the rest this sin
which is so grievous; to wit, that of not giving glory to the
Son of God, who became as nothing for our salvation?</p>

<p>Besides, after you have done your best by dissimulation, to
keep clear of the perils which surround you, you are not a whit
better; for the wicked are very sharp-sighted, and you will
never content them but by an entire renunciation of God;
wherefore, you have no rest for the body any more than for the
soul. And after declension from God, in order to comply with
the world, you have derived no benefit from it, except that you
languish as in a trance. You will ask me if, being come hither,
you shall always have assured repose. I confess that you will
not; for while we are in this world, it is fitting that we
should be like birds upon the branch. So it has pleased God,
and it is good for us. But since this little corner is vouchsafed
to you, where you may finish the remainder of your life in his
service, if he so please, or profit more and more, and be confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in his word, in order that you may be more ready to
endure persecutions, if it shall so please him, it is not right
that you refuse it. We have always to take care lest we be the
cause of our own misfortune, and draw it down upon ourselves
by not accepting the means of escape which God presents to
us. I know that it is a hard thing to leave the country of our
birth, most of all to a woman like yourself, of rank, and advanced
in life. But you ought to overcome such difficulties
by higher considerations; such as, that we should prefer to
our own country every region where God is purely worshipped;
that we should not desire any better repose for our old age
than to abide in his Church, his dwelling-place and the place
of his rest; that we should prefer to be contemptible in the
place where his name may be glorified by us, to being honourable
in the sight of men, while we defraud him of the honour
which belongs to him.</p>

<p>Concerning the doubts which may come into your mind, it
would be too tedious to reply to them all. But you have always
this as a settled point, that we must refer our many anxieties to
the Providence of God, trusting that he will provide an outlet
in cases where we see none. And in fact it is undoubted, that
if we seek him we shall find him. That is to say, he will be
with us to guide our steps, and to have a care of our affairs, to
order them well for us. True it is, that we shall not cease to
be subject to many troubles and annoyances; but let us pray
him that, having been strengthened by his word, we may
have wherewithal to overcome them. And assuredly you possess
many helps, which deprive you of the excuse which many
others have. If it shall please God to lead you hither, you will
not come so bereft of property as to have nothing to live upon,
while there are many poor people who have only burdens without
temporal provision. How many Christian women are there
who are held captive by their children! while our Lord has
given you this advantage, that you have children who not only
are ready to aid in your deliverance from captivity, but also
exhort you thereto. You have the liberty which many wish
for, of which you ought to avail yourself, that you may all the
more freely engage in the service of God. Among the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hindrances that it appears you have, your daughter may be one,
inasmuch as she is still unmarried. But instead of reckoning
that to be a hindrance, it ought rather to serve as a spur the
more readily to decide you. I understand that you love her
not merely with the common love of mothers, but with a
peculiar affection. I beseech you, then, to consider well whether
it would be better for her to be there tied down in marriage,
to live in perpetual bondage, or to be brought by you to a
place where she may be free to live as a Christian with her
husband; for you must trust that God will find out for her a
worthy person, who will be a comfort to you as well as to
herself.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> There is one thing of which it is right that you
should be made aware, in order that nothing may alarm you
as new and unforeseen. It is this, that Satan will stir up many
troubles in order to upset or to delay your pious purpose; but
when you shall have taken your fixed resolve, it will not be
difficult for you to rise above all. Meanwhile, profit by the
opportunity, now when it is offered to you; for as, in matters
of conscience, it behoves us to resolve speedily without seeking
advice or long dalliance, it is also necessary to perform
soon what we have decided on, fearing, because of the frailty
which is in us, to grow cold upon our good intention.</p>

<p>To conclude, knowing that all my exhortations must be
vain and useless, unless God make them effectual by gaining an
entrance to your heart, I shall beseech him to instruct you with
true prudence to decide upon what shall be most fitting for you
to do; to bestow steadfast constancy upon you in obeying his
will; to stretch out the hand, and be himself your guide; to
grant you such grace, that in leaning upon him, you may perceive
his assistance in everything, and all throughout.</p>

<h3>Complaints of the misconduct of several ministers in the Pays de Vaud.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Lausanne</span>, <i>this 12th January 1547</i>.
</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Seeing that this present bearer<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> has brought
me so good a testimony regarding Lion, and also that I myself
have known him to be both well qualified and zealous, insomuch
that I have no doubt of his fitness to serve the Church
of God, I am constrained to recommend him to you, assured
also that the letter of introduction which I give him to you
will be of service to him, considering the kind affection which
you bear to me. I pray you then humbly that it may please
you to hold him as recommended, to the intent that by your
means he may hereafter find an opening for the service of our
Lord Jesus, in which you may have occasion to rejoice; for
were not such my expectation, I would be very sorry to
breathe a word about it.</p>

<p>Moreover, Monsieur, if God granted me an opportunity of
speaking to you, I would willingly disburden my heart of the
scandals which lie heavy upon us here, on account of the misconduct
of some who are ministers of the word of God in your
demesne, and in their whole life give constant occasion to blaspheme
the name of God.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> I am well persuaded that you, on
being made aware of the wretchedness in which every one thereabouts
is sunk, will be as well disposed to provide for it, as I
have great regret and sorrow even to hear it spoken of. I believe,
indeed, that you will have spoken about it in council,
seeing that a poor brother who goes to your quarter, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Master Francis Maurice, will give you occasion to think thereupon.
I do not touch further on the maladies, except that I
earnestly desire that it would please God to put it in your heart
to apply an effectual remedy. And because I know that individually
you are well inclined, as becomes you, I do beseech
you, inasmuch as I ought to have the interest of the Church of
God at heart, that it would please you to hold out a hand to
those who are in trouble for having borne themselves faithfully
in God's service and yours: Wherefore, Monsieur, after having
humbly commended me to your kind favour, I pray our good
Lord to uphold you in his safe keeping, guiding you always
by his Spirit in obedience to his will.&mdash;Your humble servant,</p>

<h3>Mission of Calvin to Switzerland&mdash;dispositions of the various Cantons.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>20th February 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>Textor will have returned to us before my letter reaches you.
The reason why I did not proceed by way of [Neuchatel] in
returning from the Swiss, was, that I had engaged to be present
with the brethren on a day that must have elapsed had I not
made very great haste. With regard to the present disturbances,
I have to remark, that the people of Bâle are either in a
state of marvellous insensibility, or they possess a wonderful
power of concealing their real feelings. They did, however,
make some exertion, but coldly, and their zeal was not to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mind. I observed great fervour at Zurich. The inhabitants
of that place were as much concerned about the people of Constance<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
as about themselves. They made over to them all their
resources, and yet the wretched state continued still to vacillate,
just as if it had been without any help whatever. If it had
stood to this hour, I think there would have been no danger for
the future. If you are in possession of any information, make
us aware of it. Some people were furious, because of a report
that the ambassadors of the people of Strasbourg were seen in
the court of Charles. To me it does not appear probable. The
people of Zurich were soon persuaded. I was, however, greatly
pleased to find that they forgot all causes of dissension, and
thought only of the common weal, being prepared to spend their
strength not less in behalf of Strasbourg than of Constance.
You can hardly credit how offensive are the terms accepted by
the cities that have surrendered; but the most disgraceful of
all is Wurtemberg.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This, to be sure, is the reward of tyrants.
I observe that the Bernese were occupied in defending their
own bounds, that they might be the less conscious of the neighbouring
conflagration. But there are very many more private
matters regarding the churches that cannot be committed to
writing. It would therefore repay the trouble if you came hither
speedily, because I have now in hand certain materials which
I must send back in a short time. I am desirous that their
contents be communicated to you, and you will infer that I am
not desirous of that without good grounds.&mdash;Adieu, my brother,
along with your whole family, to the members of which you
will convey the best greeting in my name and that of my wife.
Salute also respectfully all the brethren.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h2>CLXXXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Monsieur de Falais.</span></h2>

<h3>Search for a house for that gentleman in Geneva&mdash;Various details&mdash;Mention of Charles
V. and Francis I.</h3>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 25th February 1547</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Having received your letter by the Sieur de
la Rivière, I feared that the other, of which you made mention,
must have been lost. It has since been brought to me. In
reply, I thank God for having increased your joy and contentment.
I have written briefly a joint letter to the three companions,
to congratulate them on their welfare. I know not
whether God will one day so bless us, that they shall have no
more need of my letters. If not, I shall another time be a
little more liberal on paper.</p>

<p>As for yourself, in obedience to the commission which you
gave me, I have looked about since my return for a convenient
lodging. As for that of Clébergue,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> you would be too far away
from the neighbours you desire;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> although I have long had a
wish for it myself, for the sake of retirement, when I seek to have
leisure: And they promised to let me have an answer; but
none has come. If I had it at my disposal as they had given
me to hope, you know that it would be very much at your service.
Near us, I have not been able to find one having a
garden, which would be more suitable for you than the one
which I have taken. Not that I am quite content with the
lodging, but I took it for want of a better. You will have in
front a small garden, and a tolerably spacious court. Behind
there is another garden. A great saloon, with as beautiful a
view as you could well desire for the summer. The other rooms
have not so pleasant an aspect as I would like. But when you
have arrived, possibly we may devise some satisfactory arrangement.
With the exception of the saloon, one might find houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
better furnished and more conveniently laid out; but there would
have been no garden, and I see that is a feature which you
desire above all. However that may be, it is hired for twelve
crowns. When you see it, if you say that this is too much, I
shall have my excuse ready, that I am not such a manager as
to be very sparing of my purse, any more than of that of others.
I have hurried on the bargain solely on account of the garden.
If time hangs heavy with you where you are, it appears to me
the season will be as suitable in a month as at a later period,
provided that the weather be as favourable as it usually is at
that time. As for escort, although my brother is not here at
this moment, I can safely venture to undertake for him that he
will willingly serve you; and he has gone that road so often,
that he ought to know it well. Moreover, he has already had
to do with the boatmen: and I believe you will recollect my
advice, that you should come part of the way by water, to refresh
you. Awaiting your full resolve, we shall sow without
making any stir about it, and prune the vines.</p>

<p>As for your causes of complaint, I beseech you, Monseigneur,
to overlook many things, to avoid that vexation which does not
alleviate the ill, and cannot mend it; above all, to please to
bear with what may have been done from inconsiderate zeal,
for that is a fault which happens with the best. But I believe
the matter has been already settled in some way or other. I
hope the consequences have been modified by your prudence.</p>

<p>With regard to Sieur de Paré,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> if peradventure he should
come straight to you without passing this way, and that besides
he makes fresh overtures in regard to the proposal, you have there
Monsieur D'Albiac, who, being very intimate with him, will be
able to inform you of everything better than Maldonado can
have done. And it will be right to make diligent inquiry; for
I would fear that by the follies of his youth he may have had
some disease, such as many persons have now-a-days. I openly
avow to you my fear, choosing to exceed in that respect, rather
than to conceal anything until it be too late. You will ask
me wherefore then I have put off so much time already. But
my conjectures on this point have arisen since. It would indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
have been the shortest way to communicate by word of mouth,
if I had conceived in my mind all that I do now. I set the
matter before you, that you may think of it. For I would not
have that reproach,&mdash;I mean not only in the sight of the world,
but also before God,&mdash;that the girl should have been in any
way wronged by my concealment. I am aware, that by reason
of its being a malady so common and prevalent, many make
scarcely any difficulty about it. But I suspect that you, like
myself, will have your scruples.</p>

<p>To make an end, Monsieur, after having humbly commended
me to your kind favour, and that of Madame, I entreat our
good Lord to have you in his keeping, which is the one thing
needful of our whole life, as well for this present time as that
which is to come; I mean that he may always make you to
feel as he does now, that you are under his guidance. All
those who do not write, humbly commend them to your good
graces, and to those of Madame.</p>

<p>
Your servant and humble brother,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">John Calvin</span>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monsieur, he who will present you this letter, is the ambassador
from this town. There are two who proceed to your
quarter, I know not wherefore, that is to say, on account of
their private affairs, which they have to settle together. I have
thought it well to inform you of this, for no other reason, save
that I presume you would have been sorry not to have been told
of it. For if your affairs admit of your deciding to come, you
may avail yourself of this means of communication; not that
there is need of great ceremony, as we have already spoken of
it, but only in order that they may not fancy themselves
slighted, especially if you should come hither. I speak the
language of the country. If there are any good tidings, I hope
that they will bring them to us. But there is need for God
humbling us, from whichever side it may come. I hope, however,
that our Antiochus,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> who presses us at present, will be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hard pressed, that he shall be regardless of the gout in his
hands and in his feet; for he will have it over his whole body.
As regards his companion, Sardanapalus,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> may God have a
like care of him! for they are both well worthy to have the
same measure meted to them.</p>

<h3>Instructions regarding the <cite>Apology</cite>&mdash;alarming rumours current at Geneva&mdash;Calvin's
confidence.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 7th of March 1547</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I forgot in my last letter to mention the subject
of the <cite>Apology</cite>, and I know not how it had escaped me.
Saint André had the copy; and in so far I was not deceived in
my opinion. But as matters stand at present, if you should
think of printing it, I do not see anything there will be to
change. To soften it down, that is not possible; and the times
will not warrant its being kindled into greater vehemence, at
least with any effect. And if you determine to have it printed
at Strasbourg, I am not very sure that they will venture to
admit it as it is. "<em>For what can he dare to do who hath once
involved himself with a tyrant?</em>"<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Here there would be more
liberty. I recollect that you spoke to me, immediately after
having seen it, about correcting some points, but without signifying
to me what these were, nor how to be corrected. Will
you therefore please to let me know your wish by the first opportunity,
and what you desire that I should do? As for some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to translate it into Latin, you have one at hand sufficiently
elegant, should you think proper to make use of him.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Here,
also, we might doubtless find one; for want of a better, I shall
undertake it myself,&mdash;and that I hope I may do, without boasting;
for provided that it is perspicuous, that will be sufficient;
and besides, the barbarism of <cite>Majestas vestra</cite>, which one must
employ, forbids a too exquisitely ornate style. In any event,
however, we shall have need of your advice, in case we undertake
it here. Moreover, our people are in some alarm. But I
do not think they have any cause. You know very well that
frontier towns are very apt to take fright; and forasmuch as
we have Granvelle for a neighbour,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and we hear talk of a levy
of men, one is somewhat in doubt. As for me, I think differently,
for it is not the proper season for attempting anything
here. But we must let many rumours glide past, even as we
cannot hinder water from going downwards. However matters
turn out, I am very glad that our Lord arouses us, in order to
make us turn to himself; and that is the greatest mercy that
can happen to us, that we may be led to commit ourselves in
real earnest to his protection.</p>

<p>Making an end for the present, Monsieur, after having
humbly commended myself to the kind favour both of yourself
and Madame, and having presented the respects of our neighbours,
I pray our good Lord to have you in his holy keeping,
to guide you in all your paths, to show you what is right and
fit for you to do, and to give eventually a good and prosperous
result.</p>

<p>You will perceive by the letter of Sire Nicolas how it goes
with your money. He has also informed me of the choice
which he sets before you; you will make your election as
opportunity presents itself.</p>

<h3>Disputes of M. de Falais with Valeran Poulain&mdash;Reports of the expected arrival of
the former in Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 15th March 1547</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I am glad that you have our brother, Master
Peter Viret, to cheer you in the midst of the annoyances which
must have been very hard upon you, seeing that I have been
tormented more than I can express through mere sympathy.
But I hope that God has applied a remedy as regards the actual
issue; and assuredly he has cared for you by sending you
him from whom you may receive as effectual consolation as
from any man in the world, so that I am in nowise sorry that
I did not undertake the journey; for I do not fear that you
will have any need of me. For this reason, also, I shall make
my letters to you shorter.</p>

<p>Concerning the person you allude to,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> I am not aware of
having given him any reason to think that I deemed your complaints
excessive; but fearing lest some illness might attack
you, and also thinking it unbecoming that you should enter
into contention with a man of his disposition; considering on
the other hand his audacity, and what a venomous animal is apt
to emit when pressed, I entreated you to take the whole with
moderation, so far as might be possible. Besides, I know him
well, and do not so much fear his ill-will, as to wish that the
Church of God should suffer from my dissimulation. But I
do not see now what I can do in the matter, and indeed there
is no present need. For where he is known, his reputation is
already lower than we need. Where he is unknown, nothing
would be gained by speaking of him, unless he endeavours to
insinuate himself. But yet God may make him wise, after
having suitably chastised him on account of his foolishness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>I now come to your journey. Although I see no danger in
the way, either of ambush, or of other proceedings of a like
kind, nor yet of open violence,&mdash;nevertheless, as for the first,
I have given no assurance to any one to that effect, but on the
contrary rather have my suspicion. In the second place, as
regards the time of your coming, I have spoken as one who
knew nothing at all about it. It is true that when I am asked
if you have an intention of coming to see us, I am not very
obstinate in the denial thereof to my friends, fearing lest they
might think me a double dealer. And even when I have hired
the house, not only he who spoke to you, but some others
also, have at once conjectured that it was for yourself. I have
answered them, Yea, that it was possible, but that there were
others for whom it might be; that I took it thus at a venture,
not doubting, however, to find a tenant to put into it. I cannot,
however, hinder many from guessing about it, and persuading
themselves, without my breathing a word on the subject, that
you are coming. However, if it please God, you shall have no
prejudice thereby so far as I am concerned. I hope, if the
Lord will, that next week Master Peter Viret will bring us
your news. If after having heard our brother Saint André,
you have anything new to tell me, you will find a suitable
messenger in him.</p>

<p>Whereupon, Monsieur, having affectionately commended me
to your kind favour, and to that of Madame, and having presented
to both of you the remembrance of my wife and friends,
I beseech our good Lord to have you always in his keeping,
to comfort you, to strengthen and perfect you in every work
for his glory, and your salvation. Amen.</p>

<p>

<h3>Severe reprobation of his behaviour towards M. de Falais&mdash;reply to a calumny directed
against the Reformer.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>March, 1547</i>.]
</p>

<p>Greeting,&mdash;I only received your letter this day, which was
later than was proper. Meanwhile, however, I think that the
conversation of our friend Viret has done something towards
changing your mind on the point. When I heard Saint André's
account of the matter, I briefly replied that I was not a little
grieved to find that you had thus sullied by your last act
whatever praise you had earned, in the discharge of a mission
so illustrious. And I am not indeed so light-minded, as to
pronounce a judgment after hearing merely the one side of a
question. Nor is my vision blinded by the splendour of rank;
but while I hear men indifferent, and giving expression to
no accusing word, I am constrained to think that you acted
neither with prudence nor propriety in soliciting the girl in
marriage. But I am still more displeased, seeing she complains
that you circumvented her by means of numerous
baseless accusations, and indirect arts. You mention to me
Bucer and Bernardino. If you had done nothing but with
their advice, you would, assuredly, never have set about what
you did. Do you suppose that your cause will meet with their
approval? I mentioned in a former letter, regarding the
younger [lady] to whom you aspired, what I thought was censurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in her. In seeking after this one, you seem to have
forgotten what you wrote to the other on your departure. Even
although nothing else had stood in the way, you ought to have
absolutely abstained from the mention of marriage until she
had reached her destination. But if what she herself testifies be
true, the engagement was brought about through the influence
of the worst inducements. Accordingly I shall not believe that
the marriage is, as you say, from the Lord, until you prove that
she says what is untrue, when she affirms that you had beforehand
engrossed her mind with numerous calumnies. Albeit,
she strongly asserts that she gave you no credence, and that no
engagement was formed between you, but that she always
expressly stipulated to be allowed to do everything in accordance
with the advice of Monsieur de Falais. She says, however,
that you affirmed that his will was quite well known to you, that
the only difficulty would be with his wife, as she still regarded
with admiration the fumes of nobility. These were not the
tokens of God; but you prohibit me from believing them. I
can do nothing less, however, than hear both sides. When
I reflect on the whole circumstances, certain particulars appear
with which, I confess, I am displeased. You remind me
that illustrious men are sometimes guilty of grave offences.
It is on other grounds, however, that I love and reverence
M. de Falais, than on account of the mock greatness on which
alone most of the nobility pride themselves. In the next
place, I have, as yet, heard nothing from him but reasonable
complaints. Moreover, I have looked more to the matter itself
than to the persons. I wish that you had never involved yourself
in those troubles; but since it has so happened, it remains
for me to desire to see you relieved from them in a short space,
which I trust is now accomplished.</p>

<p>With regard to the estate which I am said to have purchased
with so many thousands, I should indeed be silly if I spent
many words in rebutting falsehoods so gross. There is no
one here, or in the whole vicinity, who is not aware that I do
not possess a foot of land. Moreover, my acquaintances well
know that I never had money sufficient to purchase an acre,
unless when I am paid what enables me to meet the expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of the quarter. I have surely not reached the point alleged,
as I am still using in my house another's furniture; for neither
the table at which we eat, nor the bed on which we sleep, is my
own. Whence, then, those reports? I know not, unless it be
that godless men so malign me, in order to fix a brand on the
Gospel. They will never, however, prevent me from being
truly rich, because I am abundantly satisfied with my slender
means; and while my poverty is a burden to no one, it is
nevertheless an alleviation to some.</p>

<p>Adieu, and believe that I am friendly disposed towards you.
I wish there may sometimes occur occasion for correspondence,
&amp;c.</p>

<h3>Weakness of the Genevese magistracy&mdash;Expectation of Viret's arrival in Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>27th March 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>I am in doubt with regard to your coming to us.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Roset, as
far as I hear, exceeded due bounds in explaining to you the
necessity for it, although he is not the only one who errs in
this respect; for the whole council is in a state of groundless
agitation. I see no one of the whole number in whom I can
put confidence. I certainly observe no one here who can be
said to be judicious. They show no boldness in a good and
praiseworthy cause. So childish are they all, that they are
frightened by the silly shake of a head, while a man of no consequence
displays his insanity. I do not defend my cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
under the form of a public one, carried on in my absence. If I
desist from prosecuting it, the whole consistory will of necessity
go to ruin. Moreover, they so conduct themselves as to
extort daily clamours in the course of their sermons; otherwise
the entreaties of Roset would not have particularly influenced
me. Just now, our brother has made known to me from
Saint André, that our comic actor Cæsar, and certain of his
faction, have been making diligent inquiry as to whether you
were coming hither immediately. I observe, therefore, that
there is a strong desire for you on the part of some, that others
expect you because they are aware that you have been summoned.
With no one belonging to the council have I any
communication that can be relied on, Michel<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> alone excepted;
but he is neither very sharp-sighted, nor is he even admitted
to the more private deliberations. John Parvi makes a magnificent
offer of his services, but he is not the thing. Besides
these, no one has come near me. Certain guesses, not lightly
formed, have made me suspicious of Corna. I indeed love the
man, but he does not permit me to confide in him. In the
first place, he is timid; in the next, he is distrustful; and,
finally, he adores that shadow, or ghost if you will.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Those
who are desirous that the matter should be arranged without
disturbance, hope that you would prove a suitable pacificator.
The party composing the faction itself is anxious for you, with
the view of being somewhat relieved from its difficulties by
your mediation. We desire and solicit you, I myself in particular,
that you may see, judge, and do whatever in your opinion
shall be for the interest of the Church. But observe its wretched
condition. Farel lately learned that he had been unfortunate
in turning to me for assistance, because nothing could be done
unless he were separated from me. Nothing assuredly would
be more agreeable to me, than if all matters here were brought
to a happy issue by your interference, even though I were
banished to the Garamantes. But this mode of procedure will
be as little satisfactory to you as to myself. I mention this
plan as that prescribed by the most moderate, as they wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
be thought. But if you could be here by Tuesday next, and
remain until Monday, you might have my opinion of this complicated
matter; you would, in that case, I presume, conduct
public worship. Should it be necessary for you to return
sooner, I do not advise you to subject yourself to so much
trouble for no purpose. If the arrangements of your church
do not permit you to come in such good time, I have nothing
to say; but if I were in your place, I know what I would do;
I do not, however, wish you to be guided by my judgment.
Adieu, therefore, brother and dearest friend, along with your
wife and brothers, all of whom you will greet in my name.
Des Gallars sends his warm thanks to you through me, and he

<h3>Anxiety regarding the Churches of Germany&mdash;advice to Musculus.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>21st April 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>If I were to follow out the subject in this letter, as time and
the present condition of things demand, I see that there would
be no end to it. There are, besides, other reasons that prevent
me from entering on this forest so full of thorns. I was unwilling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
however, to send away this youth wholly empty, who
had come in my way, without at least testifying to you, in the
present calamitous state of your church, and as becomes the
friendly relations subsisting between us, that I ever bear you in
mind. Indeed, when the earliest rumours reached this, you
were among the first, of those whose danger caused me agony,
to occur to my mind; and when the ungovernable violence of
my grief had hurried me to Zurich, as soon as I fell in with
Bernardino,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> who had arrived about half an hour before I
met him, I began at once, forgetful alike of salutation and
everything else, to make inquiries after you. I confess, however,
that I was solicitous about your safety, in proportion to
the strength of the fear I had, lest you should abandon the
Church in such a time of need, as usually happens when matters
are desperate and past recovery; or rather lest, being as it
were deserted by your flock, you should betake yourself elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
for it is difficult, amid so great darkness, to discern
what is most expedient. Now, howsoever severe the trial may
have been, I yet rejoice that the Lord has caused the spirit of
prudence and counsel to spring up in you and your fellow-ministers,
and has sustained your minds with the spirit of fortitude,
as far as might be in circumstances not the best. I also
give God thanks, that in whatsoever way matters have been
improved, a short breathing time is granted you, until at length
tranquil serenity may clearly dawn upon you. Meanwhile, it is
proper we should learn, that it has been usual with God in all
ages to preserve his own Church in a wonderful way, and
without human protection. Relying therefore on this ground
of confidence, let us strive to break through whatever difficulty
there may be, and let us never lose heart, even although we
should be destitute of all things.</p>

<p>Adieu, most upright brother, and one dear to me from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bottom of my heart, as also your fellow-ministers, all of whom
you will very affectionately salute in my name. May the
Lord Jesus be present with you, guide you by his Spirit, and
bless your holy labours. You will also convey to your family
my best greeting.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Steps taken at Basle to retract a promise of marriage made to Valeran Poulain.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this first of May</i> [1547.]
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I wrote to Myconius,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> as you will see by the
copy which I send you. I was of opinion that it was enough,
because the judges will better comprehend my meaning from
his mouth. It will have more weight, because the prosecution
of the suit will not thus be so vehement on my part, as if I
should take upon me to write to them, thus making myself too
much a party in the matter. I believe that our brother, Master
Peter Viret, will do the same in regard to the Sieur Bernard
Mayer, in consequence of what I have told him. Should there
be any need for it, he condemns himself of treachery in the
letters which he has written to me. For after having requested
me, in the month of January, to intercede for him in regard to
the marriage of Merne, he has told me that Wilergy was in
love with him <em>many months before</em>: so much so, as to ask him
in marriage, rather than wait to be asked. How is that to be
reconciled, unless he wanted to have both of them? But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
must be cut short in the whole of this troublesome nonsense;
seeing that it is quite unworthy of a hearing. I have no doubt
that the judges will very soon put an end to that.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having heartily commended me to your kind
favour and that of Madame, without forgetting the three
Demoiselles, I pray our good Lord to have you in his keeping,
to confirm you always in patience, to deliver you from
the annoyance of this importunate suitor, and to bring you
into assured prosperity.</p>

<h3>Confused state of the Church&mdash;hopes and fears for the future.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>18th May 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>Greeting:&mdash;It would not require a letter of very great
length, were I to comply with your request to write to you at
full length my opinion of the present state of general disorder;
because when matters are in so great confusion, I not only abstain
from passing any judgment, but I do not even venture to
inquire into what may be the issue of them. For as often as I
have begun the attempt, I have been immediately involved in
darkness so intense, that I thought it better to close my eyes
upon the world, and fix them intently upon God alone. I only
speak of myself, as I am here situated. Had I been placed in
the situation which some others occupy, my mode of procedure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
might then have required to be changed. Besides, I cannot from
this retreat as from a watch-tower observe the circumstances
that go to the formation of a judgment. And if anything
reaches me, it comes late. Further, nothing can with certainty
be determined, until the whole particulars are gathered together.
But at present the more private counsels, from which an opinion
is chiefly to be formed, are unknown to me. What folly then
would it be for me to fatigue myself to no purpose or profit, by
occupying my attention with what is obscure! "What," therefore,
you will say, "do you alone wish to enjoy undisturbed quiet
amid the ruins of the Church?" On the contrary, I sigh
anxiously night and day, but I repel as much as I can all needless
reflections that from time to time steal upon me. I do not,
nevertheless, succeed in this so far as I could wish; it is,
however, something, that I do not indulge a prurient disposition.
I occupy myself in considering what is already done;
and I connect matters that occur from day to day, with what
preceded them. Reflection on these things furnishes me, I
confess, with various grounds both of hope and fear. But because,
as I have said, there are so many opposing reasons, I
restrain myself in good time, lest I say anything rashly and
beyond what is proper. The prediction, indeed, which you
gave in your letter, will never deceive us, even although heaven
and earth were mingled in confusion together, viz., that God
will take so peculiar a care of his own Church, as to preserve
it even amid the annihilation of the whole world. Excuse the
brevity of this epistle, as I was warned a little before supper
of the departure of the messenger. [My] brother had told me
before mid-day, that he was ready for the journey: I would
not have written, if he had gone so soon. He returned after
three o'clock: I had thus less time than I should have had.
Adieu: may the Lord direct you by his Spirit, and preserve
you safe.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>The sending of a minister&mdash;perplexities regarding anticipated events in Germany.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 18th May 1547</i>.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Since your convenience has not permitted
your coming hither as we had hoped, it is enough if God
graciously grants you health where you are. For albeit I
might desire to be near you, nevertheless I prefer what is best
for you. Concerning the man of whom Maldonado spoke to
you, besides the knowledge which I have had of him while he
has been here I have made inquiry about him at his old master,
Gallars, who tells me that he found him very leal and serviceable.
It is true, that he would not reckon him qualified to
manage great affairs, unless one should instruct and set him
his lesson; but that in the carrying out of whatsoever he shall
be commanded to do, there will be nothing wanting; nay, that
he will even be vigilant. And even as regards the former
quality, I do not undervalue him. For a staid and modest
man is far better, than one who is overbold and venturesome.
You will decide according to the turn of your affairs, in order
that the Sieur d'Albiac may send him; and thus you may not
remain long unprovided. Moreover, I hope that God has rid
you of the annoyances wherewith that marplot<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> has been so
long teasing you. That done, you may be altogether at ease
about your house.</p>

<p>We are still on the lookout for news about the general state
of the church. If God intends so sorely to afflict us, as to let
loose that tyrant upon us,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> who only seeks to ruin everything,
we must be quite prepared to suffer. Considering that He
who has us in charge, rules in the midst of his enemies, it
becomes us to have patience, consoling ourselves in the assured
hope, that in the end he will confound them. But yet I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that he will provide against these great troubles, supporting
our weakness; and that he will check the boldness of those
who triumph before the time, and that against himself.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having humbly commended me to your kind
favour, and that of Madame, and having presented to both of
you the remembrances of my wife, I pray our good Lord to
guide you continually, to watch over you and to enlarge you
in all his mercies. I abstain from entering upon the proposal
which the Sieur Maldonado has brought me, about settling a
church in that quarter;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>&mdash;for I know not what to say about it,

<h2>CXCV.&mdash;To Monsieur de Falais.</h2>

<h3>Information in regard to a house&mdash;advice on the subject of a marriage proposed for a
relative of Monsieur de Falais.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 26th of May 1547</i>.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I hope that the bearer of these presents will
be the captain of our town,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> from whom I have hired the house.
He has a mind to betake himself to your quarter, in order to
confer with you. He has offered me an alternative condition.
In the first place: should it please you to lend him money for a
certain term, that the house shall remain pledged to you in
security for the repayment, without paying any rent; and that
of the repairs which you may make for your convenience, he
shall bear a part: secondly, that he should sell it to you. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
true that he is not the feudal superior, but he engages at all
risks to maintain and warrant you in the sale of it out and out.
In this case, he must have three hundred crowns for it. If
your intention is to purchase, you will discuss the price with
himself, making the best bargain you can. It is very certain,
that assuming the responsibility of keeping it in repair, he will
not readily give it for two hundred crowns. You will have to
choose between these two conditions, and to arrange with himself,
if you see it to be for your advantage. If so be that you
do not enter into agreement with him, I have told you already
that the house could not be secured to you, consequently you
would need to look about elsewhere. For you will not prevail on
him to put it into a proper state for your accommodation, unless
you go about it in this way. And in good earnest, if you purpose
to come here about the end of summer, I advise you to
endeavour that the repairs may be made before your arrival, to
avoid having your heads broken, and many other inconveniences.
I believe that the plan I have laid down would please
you very well, so that your absence need be no hindrance, and
it will be quite easy to have the thing done. He does not
think much repair is needed, but I suspect it will not amount
to less than forty crowns. Wherefore, the purchase would
seem to me more expedient, especially if you could agree at
two hundred crowns, and that he would take upon himself to
warrant in perpetuity. I desire that you may do something
in this matter, provided it be to your advantage.</p>

<p>The Sieur de Parey<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> arrived last evening, and came to call
for me about nine o'clock. As it was rather late, we had
scarcely leisure to speak together, so that I do not yet know
the position of his affairs. After having spoken to Sieur Maldonado,
I would advise that you only inform the girl of the
nature of the objection, without mentioning to her any mishap
which may have occurred to him; for all that would be told
over again afterwards. Therefore, I would merely let her understand:
"He sleeps little, there is somewhat of levity about
him, wherefore some danger might be apprehended from his
peculiar constitution. Consider, then, whether you would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
patient if God were to visit you with such a trial." That, in
my opinion, would be sufficient. And according as you shall
see her disposed, you will do what you think right in the
matter. We have had some report of the decision, and he,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
complaining of the sentence of the judges, glories in his shame.
May God give him a better mind.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having humbly commended me to the kind favour
of yourself and of Madame; and having presented to you the
remembrances of Des Gallars and of my wife, I pray our good
Lord to have you always in his keeping, to rule and guide you,
and bestow grace upon you to glorify him always.</p>

<p>It is enough that you be informed who the bearer is. I do
not know if he will have other company along with him, for he
went away in such haste, that without having spoken of it to
me, he came this morning all booted and spurred, to bid me
adieu. You see what has been the cause of my not having
been able to communicate with Maldonado, for he went away
yesterday evening to sleep at Tourné. That is also the reason
wherefore I have not sent you any compliments from him.</p>

<h3>Interview of Calvin with a senator of Berne&mdash;advantage secured over the party of the

<p>Zerkinden<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> was here. I laid bare the ailments, and at the
same time suggested the remedy of which we had spoken together.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
He approved of it, but he thinks it will be difficult
to obtain it. If, however, he come to Berne in time, he will
make trial; for he admits that, in such an emergency, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
nothing that should not be attempted. I am, however, afraid
that others may be sent thither before him, who, as is usual
with them, after making a great display, will perform nothing.
Thus, what has been for long desired will be granted too late.
But may God look to this, as to all other matters!</p>

<p>We had here lately some little trouble about slashed breeches.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
This was the pretext, but they had already begun to break out
into the greatest license. When the <em>Two Hundred</em> had been
summoned at their request, we were all present. I made a
speech, which in a moment extorted from them what with firm
expectation they had eagerly swallowed; for I discoursed about
sources of corruption in general, premising that I was not
speaking against these trumperies. They fall into a rage, and
gnash with their teeth, as they do not dare openly to shout.
By this one experiment, however, they learned, what they had
not supposed to be the case, that the people are on our side.
The tragic Cæsar hastily set off on a journey the following
day, to avoid being present at the public procession, which that
meeting rendered hazardous and puerile, whereas he was hoping
that it would be the token of a certain supreme authority.
He had returned to terms of friendship with Romanel, with a
view to concuss the whole city, with no one to interpose. We,
however, have unexpectedly shattered all his plans. Thus
does God make sport of those Thrasoes!</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and most sincere friend. May the Lord be
continually present with you, and bless and prosper your labours.
You will hear the rest from Rebitti. Salute your wife
in the name of me and mine.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Recommendation of John de Budé&mdash;Uncertainty of the news from Germany.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>the 4th of June 1547</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I have nothing to write you at present, except
that the bearer is one of the sons of the late Mr. Budé.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
When you shall have made his acquaintance, you will find him
so excellent, that you will esteem him worthy of being loved by
all those who love God, even if the memory of his father had
not of itself recommended him. He is none of those who make
a great show and parade. And all the more on that account is
he valued by me, and I know that so it will be with you. His
intention is to go to see Bâle and Strasbourg, then to return
without making any long sojourn in those parts. Notwithstanding,
I have advised him to make full inquiry whether the
roads will be safe before going further, and he has promised
me to do so; for where there is no necessity, it would answer
no purpose to put himself in danger. I believe that before he
arrives there, you will be no longer in deliberation with regard
to Sieur de Parey. For the prolonged delay which he asks
for, is by no means with a view to strengthen his resolution;
and indeed I conjecture, that it has been cautiously suggested
by his relations, thinking that between this time and that he
might alter his mind, seeing that they must be acquainted
with his humour.</p>

<p>We are quite amazed to have no news that can be depended
upon. One may perceive the disorder which prevails in Germany,
and the wretched management. If there had been a
grain of salt among them, they would have looked well to their
affairs, before they came to the knowledge of that which was
to be known far and wide three days afterwards. But what do
I say? <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est consilium, non est fortitudo absque domino.</i>
Therefore they are taken unawares.</p>

<p>To make an end, Monsieur: having humbly commended me
to your good grace and of Madame, and having presented the
like remembrances to you on the part of my wife and others,
I supplicate our good Lord always to have a care of you, to
rule you by his Spirit, to strengthen you against all stumbling-blocks
and annoyances, as well as the whole of your household.
Although I have not leisure to write to the young ladies, I

<h3>He exhorts him to follow the example of the rest of his family, and retire to Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 19th June 1547.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Although I am personally unknown to you, I
do not hesitate on that account to write you privately, hoping
that my letter will be welcome, as well for the sake of the
Master whom I serve, as for the matter of which it treats; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
also that those who have induced me to do so, have credit
enough with you, as I believe they have, to secure me access.
I have heard of the upright spirit which our Lord has given
you, wherefore let us all praise him. For although you may
have many temptations of a worldly kind where you are, to
impede and distract you, you nevertheless do not cease to groan
under the unhappy captivity in which you are held, desiring to
escape from it. And indeed your honest zeal has been already
partially manifested, when, in place of hindering the party who
were about to shift their quarters, you confirmed them in their
good purpose, and instead of delaying, have endeavoured to
forward their departure, only regretting that you could not
follow them immediately. Now, then, seeing that Satan has
many means to damp our zeal in well-doing, and that our
nature is very apt to side with him, you must stir up the fire
which God by his Spirit has already lighted in your heart, until
the good desire be realized. You must abandon everything as
hurtful which separates you from him, in whom lies all our
happiness, and with whom if we are not united, we forfeit life
and salvation. We do not mean, however, to condemn all
those who live elsewhere, as if the kingdom of God were shut
up within our mountains, while we know it is extended over
all. But it is right, wheresoever we are, that God should be
honoured by us, and we are nowise to be excused, if we pollute
the earth which he has sanctified to our use. If we are in a
place where we are not permitted to acquit ourselves of our
duty, and where the fear of death leads us to do what is evil,
we ought, knowing our grievous infirmity, to seek the remedy:
which is, to withdraw from such bondage. Since our Lord has
opened your eyes to let you see what an evil it is to defile yourself
with superstition, it only remains for you to come forth
of it. Besides, you have less excuse than another, considering
the position which you hold, for the reckoning will be twofold,
if instead of shewing the way, as you are bound to do, you
give occasion to those who see you, to step aside out of it.</p>

<p>As for the other difficulties which are peculiar to your present
circumstances, I refer myself to your own experience.
More than all that, you have to consider that if the good lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with just reason dreaded to finish the remainder of her life
there, you may well fear a longer period of languishing, according
to the ordinary course of nature. There is assuredly no
to-morrow that we can make ourselves sure of. Therefore, on
the other hand, you ought to make the greater haste, for fear
you should be taken unawares. You see, therefore, that God
is urging you in every way. Howsoever the matter may be
settled, I pray you, Monsieur, not to allow the grace which God
has given you to be quenched. If he has given you worldly
riches, have a care lest in place of rendering them in homage
to him, you may be hindered by them from serving him. I
need not tell you, that he has given you a help which every
one has not. This is, that you have a Sarah who will be ready
to follow you, whithersoever that kind Father shall call you;
so that it depends upon yourself alone whether or not you shall
follow the example of our father Abraham. It is quite true
that you will find no spot on earth where you can be beyond
the reach of trial, as indeed it is not reasonable to expect our
faith to be exempt from these anxieties. But since the present
is a time of conflict, there is nothing better for us than to fall
back upon our standard, where we may receive courage to do
battle steadfastly even unto death. It is an advantage not to
be despised, when God gives us leisure to confirm our faith,
that the preparation may be of service to us in due time and
place. For this ought to be quite enough for us, when he arms
us with his strength for victory, before putting us to the proof.
But seeing that the very beginnings are difficult, and perseverance
still more so, the best resource is to pray God that he
would stretch out his hand to you, and give you courage to
surmount all obstacles. To which end we also would beseech
him along with you, that he would please to shew himself
your protector even unto the end, upholding you not only
against the wicked, but also against Satan their chief. Having
humbly commended me to your good favour, and to that of
Madame your wife....</p>

<h3>Citation of the wife of Amy Perrin before the Consistory&mdash;case of Gruet&mdash;news from
Germany.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>2d July 1547.</i>
</p>

<p>We must now fight in earnest. The wife of the comedian
Cæsar was again summoned to the Consistory, on account of
her frowardness.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> While there, though she received no provocation,
in the form even of too harsh a word, she vomited forth
more venom than on any previous occasion. First of all, she
denied the right of our court to take cognizance of her, even
supposing she had been guilty of a delinquency. In the next
place, she complained that she was deeply branded with ignominy,
by being compelled to appear in a place to which the
depraved and criminal could alone of right be summoned.
When one of the assessors sought to restrain her intemperate
behaviour, she turned her fury upon him. Abel then interposed,
and expressed his surprise that she had at first professed
that she was too modest, or too little given to speaking,
to be able to answer at greater length, whereas she was a
match in abuse for as many as there might be. At this her
fury boiled all over. "No, indeed," she says, "but you are a
reviler, who unscrupulously slandered my father. Begone,
coarse swine-herd, you are a malicious liar!" She would have
almost overwhelmed us by her thunders, had she not been
forcibly extruded. The Senate desired that she should be
more closely imprisoned. She escaped by means of that matron
who is wont to take under her patronage all bad causes. One
of her sons accompanied her in her flight. Accidentally meeting
Abel not far from the city gate, she insulted him afresh, and
even more shamelessly than before. Abel said nothing, but
conducted himself with the greatest moderation, just as he had
done in the Consistory. Next day a paper is found in the
pulpit, threatening us with death, unless we remain silent. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
send a copy of it to you.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The Senate, startled by such audacity,
orders a rigid inquiry to be made into the conspiracy. The investigation
is committed to a few. As many suspected Gruet,
he was immediately arrested.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> It was, however, a different hand;
but while they were turning over his papers, much was discovered
that was not less capital. There was a humble petition which
he had designed to present to the people in the Assemblies, in
which he contended that no offence should be punished by the
laws but what was injurious to the state; for that such was the
practice of the Venetians, who were the highest authority in
the matter of government; and that in truth there was danger,
while this city submitted to be ruled by the brain of one man
of melancholy temperament, of a thousand citizens being destroyed
in the event of any outbreak. Letters were also found,
chiefly written to André Philippe, and to others. In some he
named me; at other times, he had enveloped me in figures of
speech, so clumsily contrived, however, that one could lay his
finger on what he meant to conceal. There were, besides, two
pages in Latin, in which the whole of Scripture is laughed at,
Christ aspersed, the immortality of the soul called a dream and a
fable, and finally the whole of religion torn in pieces. I do
not think he is the author of it; but as it is in his handwriting,
he will be compelled to appear in his defence, although, it may
be, that he himself has thrown into the form of a memorandum,
according to the turn of his own genius, what he heard from
others; for there are mutilated sentences, crammed with solecisms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and barbarisms. I know not whether Jacoba, whose sister
is the wife of Des Gallars, has been apprehended. There is,
indeed, a decree of the Senate [for that purpose.] What
Vandel's sentence will be is still doubtful; but he is in considerable
danger.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Such was the state of things when I wrote.
You know that our Syndics have little enough judgment, otherwise
the Senate is exceedingly well disposed to the cause.</p>

<p>The brethren have replied to me regarding Sonnier, that
they mean to make no change in their former resolution; for
I relaxed, as I had abstained from writing, with a view to
spare him. He eagerly made reference to the minister De
Coppet, who also wished to change his place. I advise you
to examine whether there is any truth in this.</p>

<p>The statements contained in Bucer's letter regarding those
two victories are quite certain; for a friend of mine<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> passed
through this, who had ascertained the truth of the whole
matter. He also informed me that tidings of a third victory
had been brought away within two hours before he left Strasbourg;
but he did not venture to assert this for certain. He
further mentioned to me, that when the Landgrave had come
to Leipsic on the strength of the promise made to him, he
returned without accomplishing the matter, and in despair, and
that he was collecting a new army. The name of Henry<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> was
erroneously given in Bucer's letter; for the Landgrave still
keeps him in fetters, or at least closely imprisoned. But Bucer
was speaking of Erich,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> who professes the same doctrine with
ourselves, and yet hires himself to the tyrant in disturbing
the Church. I wish that your Senate could be induced to
take the initiative in the stipulated treaty; for Pharaoh wishes
to be asked, and thinks it unbecoming his dignity to solicit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
weaker parties.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> But let them look to these and other matters,
that are now in course of arrangement. I desire nothing to
be done, unless what I judge to be fitting and useful to you.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and most sincere friend, along with your
wife and your whole family. May the Lord always direct you
and be present with you. You will salute the brethren respectfully
in my name. I and my wife salute thee and thine
in the Lord.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Solemn lessons afforded by the sad occurrences in Germany&mdash;troubles in Geneva&mdash;energetic
attitude of Calvin.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 14th of July 1547.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;From what you have written me, I am
certainly of opinion that our brother, Master Francis de la
Rivière,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> should withdraw at least for a season. For should
it so be that it suited him to return hither, he would not have
to make a long journey: and bringing with him some recommendation
from Bâle, he might make application at Berne to
be sent to Lausanne, with some provision in the meantime. I
should not however have come to this resolution, unless your
letter had helped me to it. I have merely told him that you
would be glad of his coming, in order that your family might
receive instruction from him several times in the week. For
I desired to avoid any more definite engagement, that you
might remain at perfect liberty in that matter.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>With regard to the house, I beg you will inform me what
you wish me to do about it. But let me have your letter by
the middle of August. For according to the use and wont of
the town, I have leave to renounce the bargain for the following
half year, giving intimation to that effect six weeks before
the term. By doing this, you will not be burdened with needless
expense; while I fear that by holding it for a longer
period, you may incur outlay without return.</p>

<p>I believe Saint André has told you what we have done with
<cite>the Apology</cite>. The printing shall not be delayed for want of
copy. As for the money, I am not of opinion that you ought
to withdraw any of it merely to avoid the murmurs which
might thence arise, but rather, that enjoining those who have
the charge thereof, to apply it as they ought&mdash;correcting
abuses, if there be any, you should depute some one to act for
you in the matter. However, you will determine that according
to your own discretion. But I did not like to withhold
what occurred to me, seeing that you have been pleased to
consult me on the subject.</p>

<p>We have had no news from Germany since the capture of
the Landgrave,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> who has been suitably rewarded for his baseness.
In the present position of affairs, I recognize our God's
intention utterly to deprive us of a triumphant Gospel, that he
may constrain us to fight under the cross of our Lord Jesus.
But let us be content that he return to the early method of his
dealings, in the miraculous preservation of his Church by his
own power, without the help of an arm of flesh. The trial is
hard, I confess; but our fathers have had the like, quite as
depressing, and have never been shaken in their stability.
Now is the time to put in practice the proverb, "Let us hope
and we shall see." Besides, we need not be astonished that
God has corrected us thus roughly, considering the life we have
led. But as you say, may those who have not hitherto been
touched, take note of such examples, that they may humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
themselves, and by that means prevent the hand of the
Judge.</p>

<p>There has been some want of consideration on the part of
the commissioners from this town, in not informing me of their
departure. However, I do not give up the expectation of tidings
from you by them. I do not know whether any report of
our troubles has yet reached you, but they talk of them so
loudly throughout the neighbouring country, that it would
appear all is over with us. More than that, they have often
had me dead, or at least sorely wounded. Be that as it may, I
feel nothing of it myself. And in the town we are not aware
of the hundredth part of what is said. There have, indeed,
been some murmuring and threats on the part of loose-living
persons, who cannot endure discipline. Even the wife of him
who was to go to see you,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and who wrote to you from Berne,
rebelled very proudly. But it has been necessary that she
should betake herself to the country, feeling herself but ill at
ease in town. The others, indeed, lower the head, in place of
lifting up the horn; and there is one of them who is in danger
of paying a very heavy reckoning; I know not even whether it
may not cost him his life.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The young people think that I
press them too hard. But if the bridle were not held with a
firm hand, that would be the pity. Yea, we must look to their
wellbeing, however distasteful to them it may be.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having humbly commended me to your kind
favour and that of Madame, I pray our good Lord that he may
have you always in his keeping, strengthening you by his
Holy Spirit to resist all temptations, and making you abound
in all well-doing to his honour. And seeing that the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the trial of Madame draws near, we shall remember her in
prayer for her happy delivery. My wife also presents her
humble remembrance to both of you.</p>

<h3>Indecision of the Seigneurs of Geneva&mdash;inflexibility of Calvin.</h3>

<p>There is nothing new in our affairs. The Syndics protract
the case of Gruet against the will of the Senate, which does
not, however, as would be proper, utter any protest against the
delay. For you know that few of them are judicious. I exercise
my severity in dislodging common vices, and principally
the sources of corruption among the youth. I conceal all sense
of the dangers which good men from several quarters allege to
exist, lest I should appear over solicitous about myself. The
Lord will give the issue in the way that may please himself.
Adieu, brother, and most sincere friend, as also your wife and

<h3>State of Germany&mdash;details regarding the struggles of the Reformer in the cause of
the truth at Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 24th of July 1547.</i>
</p>

<p>The electing love of God our Father, and the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, rest always upon you by the communion
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Very dear lords and brethren, I doubt not that you have
daily much news, as well from hence as from Germany, which
might prove a stumblingblock to those who are not overmuch
confirmed in our Lord Jesus Christ. But I trust in God he has
so strengthened you, that you shall not be shaken, either thereby
or by any still greater marvel which may yet arise. And verily,
if we are indeed built upon that solid stone which has been
ordained for the foundation of the Church, we may well sustain
more boisterous storms and tempests without being foundered.
It is even expedient for us that such things should happen,
that the firmness and constancy of our faith may be approved.</p>

<p>As for the state of Germany, our Lord has so abased the
worldly pride of our people, and given all power and authority
to him from whom we can look for nought but ill, as that it
indeed appears that he means himself to maintain his spiritual
kingdom wheresoever he had already set it up. It is very
true, that according to the carnal mind it is in danger; yet in
commending to himself the care of his poor Church and the
kingdom of his Son, let us hope that he will provide for all,
beyond what we can think. The danger hitherto has been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
lest human means might have dazzled our eyes. Now, however,
since there is nothing to prevent our looking to his hand,
and recalling to mind how he has preserved his Church in time
past, let us not doubt but he will glorify himself in such sort
that we shall be amazed. Meanwhile, we must never grow
weary of fighting under the ensign of the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, for that is worth more than all the triumphs of
the world.</p>

<p>As regards the rumours of our troubles which have flown
abroad, they seem, the greater part of them, in the first place,
to have been improvised; because, were you upon the spot, you
would not see a tenth part of what is told at a distance. True
it is, that we have many hard-headed and stiff-necked rebels,
who on all occasions seek only to raise themselves, and by riotous
courses to dissipate and abolish all order in the Church, and
these, indeed, as well young as old. And the state of our young
people, especially, is very corrupt; so that, when we will not
allow them every license, they go from bad to worse.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Of late,
they were sorely enraged under cover of a small matter. It was
because they were not allowed to wear slashed breeches, which
has been prohibited in the town for these twelve years past. Not
that we would make overmuch of this, but because we see that,
by the loop-holes of the breeches, they wish to bring in all manner
of disorders. We have protested, however, in the meantime,
that the slashing of their breeches was but a mere piece
of foppery, which was not worth speaking about, but that we
had quite another end in view, which was to curb and to repress
their follies. During this little conflict, the devil has interjected
others, so that there has been great murmuring. And because
they perceived in us more courage than they could have wished,
and more determination to resist them, the venom which some
of them had concealed within their heart burst forth. But this
is nought but smoke; for their threats are nothing else but a
splutter of the pride of Moab, who is powerless to execute
what he thus presumes to threaten.</p>

<p>Howsoever that may be, you need not be astonished. There
have been greater commotions stirred against Moses and against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the prophets, although they had to govern the people of God;
and such exercises are needful for us. Only beseech our Lord,
that he would vouchsafe us grace not to flinch, but that we
may prefer his obedience to our life if need be, and that we
may be more afraid of offending him than of stirring up all
the fury of the wicked against ourselves, and that at length it
may please him to allay all the tumults which might otherwise
break the courage of the unsettled, for it is that which down-weighs
me more than all the rest. This grace our Lord has
vouchsafed us, that we have a right good will to remedy the
evil, and all our brethren are well agreed to go forward earnestly
in that which is our duty, so that there is the same constancy
in all. Nothing is needful, except that this good Lord
continue to conduct his own work.</p>

<p>I entreat of you, my dear brethren, continue steadfast on your
part also; and let no fear alarm you, even although the dangers
were more apparent than you have seen them hitherto. May
the reliance which God commands us to have in his grace and
in his strength always be to you an impregnable fortress; and
for the holding fast the assurance of his help, may you be careful
to walk in his fear, although, when we have made it our
whole study to serve him, we must always come back to this
conclusion, of asking pardon for our shortcomings. And inasmuch
as you know well from experience how frail we are, be ever
diligent to continue in the practice which you have established,
of prayer and hearing of the holy word, to exercise you, and to
sharpen and confirm you more and more. Let nothing turn you
aside, as sometimes there are many colourable pretexts adduced
to justify the remission of such duties. I am convinced that it
would be much better that all those who desire to honour God
should assemble together, and that every one should call the
others thither as by sound of trumpet. But yet, it is much
better to have what you have, though it be but a part, than nothing
at all. And so, watching well against declension, seek
rather to advance in the way of proficiency, and make use of
what God gives you,&mdash;edifying one another, and in general all
poor and ignorant ones, by your good life, that so, by the same
means, the wicked may be put to confusion. In so doing, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
will perceive the hand of God upon you, to whom I pray that
he would increase in you the graces which he has put within
you; that he would strengthen you in true consistency; that,
in the midst of dogs and of wolves, he would preserve you, and
every way glorify himself in you; after having commended
me affectionately to your kind prayers.</p>

<h3>Thanksgiving for the happy deliverance of Madame de Falais&mdash;false reports concerning
the state of Geneva&mdash;details regarding the publication of the Apology&mdash;indisposition
of Calvin, and his regret at being separated from Monsieur de Falais.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 16th of August 1547</i>.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Two days after the arrival of M. Budé, I
received your letter, which you had delivered to James Dallichant;
so that all of them have been delivered. Thinking to
find a messenger, I have twice since then been disappointed;
and I was also in doubt whether to undertake the journey.
For notwithstanding the hindrances which might detain me, I
was afraid that I had no sufficient excuse. But the tidings
which have since reached us, have removed that doubt. I return
thanks to our Lord, and all our friends along with me,
for the happy delivery which he has granted to Madame, praying
that he would so bless the offspring which he has given
you, that you may have a twofold comfort in them in the time
to come, as I do also hope. We shall look for a letter from
you shortly. It is enough in the meanwhile to know that all
is well as to the main point.</p>

<p>In reply to all that you have sent to me, I had requested
Gallars to translate the <cite>Apology</cite>, promising to revise it finally
myself. But he has been so negligent, that Master Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Baulduin<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> came just in time to begin it. I send you, therefore,
his translation, which we have revised together, not to
polish it very highly, but merely to see whether the meaning
had been truly rendered, at the same time with the French
copy in the handwriting of Saint André.</p>

<p>In the Latin epistle of Dryander,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> I have corrected what
appeared to me to be right; you can follow that which shall
seem best to yourself. I hope that you will understand who
has induced me to write many things, which I did not object
to, but which appeared to me to be superfluous, or at least that
they would be of no weight with the individual to whom they
were addressed.</p>

<p>You will see the answers which I have made in the name of
Mademoiselle de Wilergy, and may give effect to, if you think
they are the right thing. I speak drily enough to the Abbess,
because of the suspicion, which is very strong.</p>

<p>If it please God to settle a church there, it will be a great
comfort to your family. But the blessing will extend much
further, and will have the effect of removing many stumblingblocks.
It is a great pity the scattering of the handful who
met at Vezel.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Our Lord, I fear, must have been disposed to
punish that excessive moroseness, which could only arise from
a despising of his blessing. However, I hope that, after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
punished the fanatics and crack-brained persons who have been
the cause of all the mischief, he will yet set up again his little
flock which remains, and will hold out a hand to them, to lead
them always in the right way.</p>

<p>What moved me to urge you about the house, was my fear
of the shame I should feel if perhaps you did arrive here and
should not find a lodging ready. Besides, the repairs which
the landlord thought of making thereon, would not make it fit
for your occupation. Thus the rent you are paying for it,
would be so much money lost, unless we should fall upon some
remedy for it. Although I have taken it for three years, it
was at my option to be quit of the bargain at the end of the
half-year, on giving intimation three weeks before the term.
At this time we shall be foreclosed of that liberty. If you
could have decided upon coming, I would have desired the
whole to be put in proper repair, that you might be exempt
from annoyance. But seeing the matter stands as it does, it
is very unadvisable indeed to charge yourself with a house
here; only I could have wished to cause you no needless expense.
But since you have allowed this half year to pass
away, we shall need to take care between this and the end of
January, so as not to enter upon the second year.</p>

<p>I perceive that the troubles which we have had here are also
exaggerated with you as well as elsewhere. At Lyons they have
had me dead in more than twenty ways. Everywhere throughout
the country they tell of wonders, of which, God be thanked,
we perceive nothing. It is very true Satan has here very many
firebrands; but the flame passes off with a blaze like that of
flax. The capital punishment which has been inflicted upon
one of their companions,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> has laid their horns in the dust. As
for your landlord,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> I know not what face he will wear towards
us when he returns. He appeared to go away on friendly
terms, at least manifesting more compunction and respect
towards me than formerly. Meanwhile, however, his wife has
played the she-devil to such a degree, that she has found it
necessary to gain the open country. It is already about three
months that he has been absent. He must needs walk softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
upon his return. Up to the present time, we have got on very
well, considering the condition of the servants of God. Had
we not been so depressed, we should have been too much at our
ease. I believe, indeed, that he may have opened the letter, and
that that may have given boldness to Valeran, and to that
worthy man with whom he was lodged, to take a second look
into them. However that may be, in complaining about it as
he does, he must at once avow himself to be a breaker-open of
letters, which is certainly the act of a lawless man. As for his
wrongs, they weigh no more with me than his person in the
scale of importance, which is a little less than a feather. Moreover,
it is evident that he was drunk, or at least seeing double,
when he thus wrote. Provided he does not go the length of
throwing stones, our patience, yours and mine, will not find it
very hard to bear with his abuse. We are not better than
David, were we even called to bear further injury, and he is at
least quite as worthy as Shimei. In that and in greater things,
let us pray God that he may vouchsafe us grace to call us to his
light, despising the calumnies of those who judge in darkness.
I am more sorry than for aught else to see him gone so far
astray.</p>

<p>If there is no pressing hurry, or if there might be more hope
of reasonable despatch in the absence of the protonotary, I
think that it would only be right to await his return, as well
that nothing may be done by halves, as to avoid the suspicion
he might take up, that you had watched the opportunity, or
anticipated the complaint he meant to make, in terms of his
letter, which was not a little dissatisfied. But should there be
any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnum aut periculum in mora</i>, this consideration ought
not to hamper you, so at least methinks. Otherwise the better
way will be, to wait for an opportunity to get rid of the whole
at once.</p>

<p>As for the book-mark&mdash;your own arms, as well as the motto,
everything will be liable to be blazoned abroad by those who,
without good ground, are, nevertheless, always open-mouthed
in speaking evil of us. Howbeit, I find nothing amiss, neither
in the one nor in the other. Even had there been no diminishing
of the expenses, there could be no harm in putting the arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at the beginning, and the motto at the end. But I am much
puzzled which of the two methods to choose, unless you were
to put your armorial bearings with the saying underneath,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui
recedit a malo præd&oelig; est expositus</i>, with the citation of the
chapter.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>As regards the marriage,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> for my part, I would by no means
consent to it. You see how confidentially I reply to you. 'The
family is very poor indeed. The noblesse of Savoy is very
different from that of your country; the man himself is well
enough, but not so steady as to withstand evil counsels; subject
to illnesses, arising chiefly from a sanguine temperament,&mdash;(you
fear one reproach; I am afraid of a quite different one, which
I would only mention if I desired to be put out of the way,
&amp;c.) You had been rash in entertaining his proposal.' Pardon
me if I am too forward. I would like better to take the other
whom I know, if it fell to me to decide. But it is full time
for me to pull up, having certainly exceeded due bounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before I have concluded, a cough has seized me, and hits me
so hard upon the shoulder that I cannot draw a stroke of the
pen without acute pain.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> There is a letter to Wendelin, to
which I would much desire to have a reply, because there is
some inquiry regarding the Commentaries on St. Paul, of
which several persons urge the printing. I hope that it shall
be profitable, otherwise I would not have composed them.
Seeing that the present bearers are not quite certain of going
so far as Strasbourg, and that even if they do go, I could not
be sure to have an answer by them, I beg you kindly to charge
some one of your servants to convey the letter in good time,
and to procure the answer.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having heartily commended me to your kind
favour, and that of Madame, and also presented to you remembrances
from my wife, I pray our Lord that it would please
him to have you in his holy keeping, to preserve to you the
blessing he has bestowed, that you may even see the fruit of
it, so as to derive more full consolation and joy; and, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
meanwhile, to help you in everything, and that continually. I
am sorry that I cannot be with you for at least a half of a day,
to laugh with you, while we wait for a smile from the little
infant, under the penalty of bearing with his cries and tears.
For that is the first note, sounded as the key-note, at the beginning
of this life&mdash;the earnest of a better, that we may smile
from the heart when we shall be about to depart from it.</p>

<p>I entreat of you to bear with my indisposition, commending
me to the goodly company.</p>

<h3>False report of Calvin's death&mdash;proposition (query) by the wife of Amy Perrin&mdash;calumnious
accusation against Idelette de Bure&mdash;journey of Farel to Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>21st August 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>I am more grateful to you than words can readily express,
for having spontaneously transferred to us your credit and service,
when you thought that we were pressed by great difficulties.
In this, however, you did nothing that was novel or
unexpected. The reason why I did not avail myself of your
offer, was that various rumours were everywhere flying about
which I thought had been extinguished, but which would have
been the more increased had I summoned hither you and Viret.
You know with what sort of men we have to deal, and how
eager they are for an opportunity of speaking against us.
Letters were daily arriving, especially from Lyons, from which
I learned that I had been more than ten times killed.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> It was
therefore proper that the ungodly should be deprived of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
occasion of talking. The senate is now quieted, and is favourably
disposed to the good cause. Amy, our friend, is still in
France.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> His wife is with her father, where she carries on her
revels in her usual fashion, and yet we requested the Senate
that all past offences might be forgiven her, if she shewed anything
to warrant a hope of repentance. That petition has not
been granted, for she has gone so far as to have cut off all hope
of pardon for herself. As the day of the [Lord's] Supper draws
near, I may meet with Penthesilæa. Froment lately made a
movement about a reconciliation, but he wished the matter to
be settled according to his own arbitration. I replied that our
church was not so destitute but that there were brethren competent
to undertake that duty. We shall make every effort.
And yet she has cruelly wounded me. For when at the baptism
of our child James, I had admitted the truth about the fault
of my wife and her former husband,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> she calumniously asserted
among her own friends, that my wife was therefore a harlot;
such is her bold impudence. I shall treat her not according
to what she deserves, but according to what my office demands.
Add that N. had invented a most calumnious fable,&mdash;to the
effect, that I had received a severe reprimand from you and Viret,
on the ground that, having been placed here by you in your
room, and by way of deputy, I abused my precarious authority.
You will now, however, come at a much more opportune time
than you would have done before. You would hear everything
that cannot be committed to writing. You might apply your
hand to wounds that are not yet well healed. We might consult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
together about the remedying of occult diseases. You will
therefore see whether you will have any leisure. I have commenced
work upon the Fathers of Trent;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> but the beginnings
proceed slowly. The reason is, I have not an hour that is
free from incessant interruptions. Adieu, most sound-hearted
brother, and matchless friend; salute respectfully fellow-ministers
and your family in my name. May the Lord be always
present with you, direct you, and bless your labours. Amen.

<h3>Mention of a letter from M. de Falais&mdash;Emmanuel Tremelli&mdash;a book by Viret&mdash;journey
of Budé and Nicolas des Gallars to Paris.</h3>


<p class="sig">

</p>

<p>Before bringing to a conclusion the matter of Beat, it seems
proper to wait the return of Textor, who I know will be here
in a short time, unless some new obstacle intervene. For
he had been compelled to remove from Macon, when Claude
the dyer lately returned from that quarter. The letter from
Bâle contained absolutely nothing of interest to you or me.
There was but one letter of Falais to me, in which he mentioned
the birth of a daughter,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> of whose death he spoke in a
second letter to Maldonado. He had besides sent a copy of
the letter of recommendation which the Landgrave had obtained
from the Emperor; but I had read a translation of it
by Pagnet fifteen days before. I send it to you in case you should
not have seen it. I had forgot the epistle of Valeran, in which
that wretch so unblushingly insults a perfect nobleman, that I
am ashamed to read it. Budé strongly solicited me to exert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
myself to bring Emmanuel<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> hither, if it could be accomplished
on any ground. His services could be of no avail to us, unless
in the professorship of Hebrew; and this office is filled by
Imbert. I wish you would excuse me to him, if you have no
objection, that he may at least understand that I am not guilty
of neglect. Girard has not yet brought the preface, although I
reminded him that he should do so to-day. Send the book on
the Church and Sacraments.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> I would read it with pleasure,
even although you did not impose that task upon me. Only I
request your permission to consult my own convenience; for I
never had less leisure than at present. The long nights, however,
will presently afford me somewhat more. Des Gallars
has left for Paris, along with Budé, as he could not otherwise
satisfy his mother; and he could not have had a better opportunity
than now, in the absence of his father-in-law. Besides,
he has it in view to bring his sister along with him; a modest
girl, I hear, and who is harshly treated by her step-father. I
wished you to know that. Adieu, most sound-hearted brother
and friend, with your wife and brothers, all of whom you will
salute in our name. May Christ be ever present with you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But I had forgot about Vernon. Sulzer obtained from the
Senate a supplement for him, so long as he should be sick,
to meet the unusual expenditure; and also half stipend for
Maigret.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Lest that arrangement should displease me, Sulzer
charged him to return to terms of friendship with me. After
asking me to come to him, he made a long enough petition for
forgiveness. I replied as I was disposed, and as I was bound
to do. The result was that he promised amendment, and I
fraternal affection, if he changed his course of life for the better.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Dedication of the <cite>Apology</cite>&mdash;mention of M. de Montmor&mdash;Sickness of Maldonado.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 10th of September 1547</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;By your last, I perceive, that I have not yet
satisfied you concerning the <cite>Apology</cite>. Although the three
points which you have noted need not retard the publication,
the excuse may be made in three sentences; because should
we enter somewhat further on explanation, we must touch upon
rather ticklish matters, which it would be better to let sleep.
I do not know to whom it would be well to address it at present,
considering the temper of the times. She has already
played a principal part: I cannot think of any of the other
persons who would be suitable. To dedicate it to the noblesse
of the Netherlands, would be a hateful proceeding. In Germany,
what states would you choose? I would therefore prefer
that no change be made in the beginning. Touching the
conclusion, although there is plenty of material, and that very
pertinent, that might be added, even as it stands it is not incomplete.
Hereafter, should occasion call for it, you will consider
whether you should add thereto, or make some other
distinct publication. However, I refer the whole to your discretion,
and merely express to you my opinion.</p>

<p>Concerning the party you inquire about, I fear that you
suppose I build marriages in the air very much at random.
But why so? for indeed I believe that I have some foundation
of reason and sound confidence. Eight months ago, the son of
M. de Montmor, with whom I was brought up in my childhood,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
informed me that he would desire above all else to
retire hither, and he continues of that mind; for it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
merely on one occasion that he has so written. He is a young
man; at least he is of the age of thirty-four years, good-natured,
very gentle, and docile. Though he has drunk deep of
youthful follies in earlier life, now that God has given him a
knowledge of himself, I believe he will be quite to your mind.
I have made diligent inquiry of Nicolas Loser, and Nicolas
Picot his son-in-law, who have spoken to him, whether there
was any taint of disease about him, such as young men acquire
in their dissolute courses. They have replied to me in the
negative. My desire has thereupon led me to build an expectation.
Should he come, as I expect, I would send him at
once to yourself; and then you can consider whether he would
be a suitable person. If he does not come within a mouth, I
know not whether I ought to expect him. But I think he will
come, to communicate to me, and forthwith return to expedite
his departure.</p>

<p>We have been like to lose the good Maldonado, for he has
been at the point of death: and the fever even now confines
him to bed, but not with imminent danger, so far as we can
discern, by the favour of God. I have prepared some verjuice,
enough for a year's provision, which awaits you, if perchance
you come. It is the produce which you have got from your
garden for the bygone year.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Monsieur, having humbly commended me to
your kind favour, and that of Madame, I pray our good Lord
to have both of you in his holy protection, to lead and direct
you, to send you whatsoever he perceives to be needful for
you.</p>

<p>

<p>The title would appear to me to read well thus: <em>Excuse

<h3>Comments by Calvin on a work by Bullinger&mdash;state of Germany and Italy&mdash;policy
of the Cantons.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>19th September 1547</i>.]
</p>

<p>It is now six months since I returned your book, with annotations,
such as you had requested me to make.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> I am surprised
that I have received no reply from you since that time.
When I was in your quarter, you reminded me that there was
to be frequent interchange of letters between us. In the meantime,
I have heard of some of your townsmen having at different
times passed through this place; I have had no one going
to you, so far as I remember. Should an opportunity of writing
be at any time afforded you, I earnestly request you will not
allow it to pass without availing yourself of it.</p>

<p>I am compelled to hear more about the disaster of Germany
than I could wish; and yet nothing is said of the condition of
Constance, which remains deeply fixed in my mind. There
was great trepidation at Strasbourg when it was supposed that
the Emperor would winter there. Moreover, even to this day,
they assert that the gates will not be opened to him, if they
receive support from any other quarter. I do not know what
the Helvetic cities may think. For a short time, indeed, all
rumours of a war to be waged against them have ceased, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
account of the Italian commotions. But what if all these cities,
struck with terror of him, do not venture upon any movement?
He already occupies Placentia and Parma,&mdash;Peter Farnese<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
having been put to death as some suppose, or at least, quite
prostrated; and so great a success may possibly be the means
of bringing Italy into a state of peaceful subjugation in the
course of this year. Were he to enter Strasbourg, he would,
you perceive, occupy an encampment whence he could invade us.
Would there then be time, my Bullinger, for you to deliberate?
For by keeping silence, do you not, as it were, present your
throat to be cut? On this point, however, I have no good
reason for making an appeal to you, for I know that your
fellow-citizens will be so wise as to desire to apply a remedy.
The neighbours [Bernese] are manifestly acting the part of
fools, in withstanding the adoption of any measures for curbing
this wild beast.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Nevertheless, as they are of their own accord
bent on destruction, may the Lord direct his own elect by the
spirit of wisdom, to make a seasonable stand against the
dangers. There are many things which ought to deter you
from the French alliance. But just as, on the one hand, it is
by no means expedient that you should be wholly bound up
with him [the French king], so, on the other, I do not see that
you are to shun all connection with him.</p>

<p>As to the rest, the boy who has delivered my letter to you,
is the son of a senator with whom I am on terms of the greatest
intimacy. He has, in virtue of our friendship, requested me
to give his son a letter of introduction to you. He lives with
your treasurer, as far as I understand. But it is his father's
design that he should prosecute the study of letters, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
he has acquired the rudiments. He is of a teachable disposition
and fond of study. I therefore beg of you to recommend
him to the masters of your school, in your own as well as my
name, not simply in the ordinary fashion, that greater attention
may be paid to him than if he were unknown. This service
will be highly gratifying to me.</p>

<p>Adieu, illustrious sir, and highly revered friend in the Lord,
along with your fellow-ministers and brethren, all of whom you
will salute in my name and in that of my brethren. May the
Lord be continually present with you, and bless your labours,
I also wish well to your wife and children.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Since my last letter nothing new has occurred,
except that our brother Des Gallars has returned, and
has also brought with him the present bearer for your service,
seeing that M. Budé did not find the person ready of whom
he had spoken to you. I think and feel assured, that this
man will quite suit you; he is so loyal and serviceable, and
knows well what is good breeding, so as to demean himself
becomingly. I have advised that he should come hither along
with you as soon as possible, and chiefly because I do not know
whether you have resolved to undertake the journey. I have
had no tidings of the individual about whom I wrote to you,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
only I have heard that some disturbance had broken out at
Noyon, which may possibly have delayed him, because he was
to have been accompanied by a steward of his own, who must
have been detained along with the others.</p>

<p>Master William Farel and Master Peter Viret have been
here for a week: your presence alone was wanting to complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the festival. Everything goes on as usual. May God of his
grace correct whatever is defective, and increase whatever little
good there may be. The good Maldonado cannot raise himself
up; so that there is no hope of his being of service to you for
the present. But when you have work for my brother to do,
he will make up for the former failure.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having presented our affectionate remembrances,
all, as well to yourself as to Madame, I pray our good Lord
to have you always in his holy keeping, to govern you by his
Holy Spirit, to bless and to help you in every way.</p>

some of which may cause you bitter sorrow, and others inspire

<h3>Rising at the Hôtel de Ville&mdash;heroic bearing of Calvin&mdash;trust in God alone.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>,] <i>14th December 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>[The enemy] are so blinded that they pay no regard to propriety.
Yesterday not a little confirmed a suspicion previously
entertained by us, that they were shamelessly striving to excite
some commotion. The <em>Two Hundred</em> had been summoned.
I had publicly announced to my colleagues that I would go to
the senate-house. We were there a little, indeed, before the
hour of meeting. As many people were still walking about in
the public street, we went out by the gate that is contiguous
to the senate-house. Numerous confused shouts were heard
from that quarter. These, meanwhile, increased to such a degree
as to afford a sure sign of an insurrection. I immediately ran
up to the place. The appearance of matters was terrible. I
cast myself into the thickest of the crowds, to the amazement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of almost every one. The whole people, however, made a rush
towards me; they seized and dragged me hither and thither,
lest I should suffer any injury. I called God and men to witness
that I had come for the purpose of presenting my body to
their swords. I exhorted them, if they designed to shed blood,
to begin with me. The worthless, but especially the respectable
portion of the crowd, at once greatly relaxed in their fervour. I
was at length dragged through the midst to the Senate. There
fresh fights arose, into the midst of which I threw myself. All
are of opinion that a great and disgraceful carnage was prevented
from taking place by my interposition. My colleagues,
meanwhile, were mixed up with the crowd. I succeeded in
getting them all to sit down quietly. They say that all were
exceedingly affected by a long and vehement speech, suitable
to the occasion, which I delivered. The exceptions were at
least few, and even they, not less than the respectable part of
the people, praised my conduct in the circumstances.</p>

<p>God, indeed, protects myself and colleagues to the extent of
the privilege implied in the declaration of even the most abandoned,
that they abhor the least injury done to us not less than
they detest parricide. Their wickedness has, however, reached
such a pitch, that I hardly hope to be able any longer to retain
any kind of position for the Church, especially under my ministry.
My influence is gone, believe me, unless God stretch
forth his hand.</p>

<p>I can make no certain reply regarding the daughter of our
neighbour, because having once already found the father difficult
to manage in this matter, I do not venture to raise any
expectation. Nothing, however, would be more expedient, in
my judgment, than for the man himself to come hither; for
the father will strenuously demand that at the very first.
Nevertheless, if you so order it, we shall make every endeavour
even in his absence. I have not yet spoken to the brother of
Du-Plessis. About their quarrel, more at another time.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and most sincere friend. Salute your colleague
and all the brethren. My wife and I wish yours every greeting.
May the Lord be perpetually present with you.&mdash;Amen.</p>

<h3>Printing of <cite>The Apology</cite>&mdash;troubles at Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>The 19th December 1547.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I shall not at present write a very long letter
to you because I was not informed that the messenger would
go away so soon. He is an engraver, who had left about two
hours before I could speak to our printer. Seeing, therefore
that your armorial bearings would not have been very well
suited to the form of the book, I immediately sent after him,
and have had them done in lead, as you will see by the proof.
I feel quite confident that you will not be sorry that a crown
was expended to make the thing quite complete. The printing
of the book is not yet begun, because it has been necessary
to recast some letters of the fount, which is the same with
which the supplication was printed, very readable and handsome.
We shall begin it this week, if the Lord will; but we
shall not touch the Latin at all, until we hear from yourself.
As I have no spare time at present, I shall put off all other
matters, and send you an answer in regard to them by Robert,
my wife's cousin.</p>

<p>We are somewhat annoyed here by those who ought to bring
us peace. I hope, however, that good shall result from it, and
that shortly, to the rejoicing of those who desire that God may
be honoured. But while our brethren are persecuted by open
enemies, we ourselves must needs be troubled by those of our
own household. There is one mercy, however, that all is for
our profit, provided that we are so well advised as thus to take
it. As I have formerly told you, do not be disturbed by anything
that is said, setting down the whole as falsehood, until
you hear from us how matters go.</p>

<p>Monsieur, having humbly commended me to your kind
favour, and to that of Madame, and the whole of your worthy
family, I beseech our good Lord to have you in his keeping, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>

<h3>Invitation to come to Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th December 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>Amid the great swellings of our commotions, I ought not,
nevertheless, to have gone so far as to ask you to come hither,
because I knew that you were detained in your own locality
by necessary occupations; and another obstacle stood in the
way of it, as it was possible some rumour of your coming
might thereupon reach the Arctei. Now, as I hope you have
more leisure, you would do a valuable service were you to
make yourself ready for the journey on the earliest possible
day. I have not yet made up my mind as to what I am
finally to do, beyond this, that I can no longer tolerate the
manners of this people, even although they should bear with
mine: and withal I do not understand why they object to my
severity. I should not, however, take it so ill, did I give
them offence without even any fault on my part, were I not
becomingly impressed with a sense of their wretchedness.
For how little of life remains to me, that I should be solicitous
about myself? But I am foolish in handling these matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in a letter, when I am confident you will be here presently.
Adieu, brother, and dearest friend. May the Lord Jesus protect
you along with your wife and whole family. You will
salute in my name, and in that of the brethren, your fellow-ministers.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Publication of <i>The Antidote</i>&mdash;statement regarding the condition of Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>28th December 1547</i>.
</p>

<p>My <cite>Antidote</cite><a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> now begins to please me, since it is so greatly
approved of by you, for before, I was not satisfied with it. But
you who know my daily labours, and still more the contests
with which I am not so much occupied as quite wasted, are
perhaps ready to excuse me when there is anything not quite
perfect. I certainly marvel that any composition worthy of
perusal can emanate from me. With regard to your exhortation,
that my colleagues and I should persist with unbroken
resolution, I may say that neither dangers nor troubles weaken
my determination. But as I am sometimes destitute of counsel
in matters where confusion so greatly prevails, I desire that God
would grant me my discharge,&mdash;a foolish wish you will say; I
admit that it is so; but what did Moses, that illustrious example
of patience? Does he not complain of too heavy a burden being
laid on his shoulders? I also am, in truth, simply tempted by
these thoughts; I do not, however, give way to them. We
have inspired some fear in our men, and nevertheless there is
as yet no appearance of amendment. Such is their shamelessness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that they devour with open and regardless ears all our
clamours; finally, the diseases of many are incurable. For
thus far we have essayed almost all methods with no success.
The last act remains, at which I wish you to be present. You
will, I suppose, have learned from my letter to Viret, how God
stilled the tragical tumult; for I had given him an injunction
to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The <em>Two Hundred</em> ordered us, and the other
ten peace makers, to make away with all dissensions.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> I wished
that the initiative should be taken by me. Our Cæsar yesterday
denied that he had any quarrel with me; I immediately
pressed out the matter from the sore. In a grave and calm
speech, I made certain sharp strictures, but such as were calculated
to wound very slightly. Although he promised reformation
hand in hand, I am afraid that I have preached but
to the deaf. I wish you would again gladden me by your
arrival. I am aware that some people have complained to
Viret of my immoderate severity. I know not what his belief is.
I scented out the fact, however, that he was afraid lest I should
too greatly indulge my ardour. I have requested him to come
hither. One in Terence says: If you were here, you would
feel differently. I might say the same. If you were in my
place, I know not what you would do. But amid a multitude
of sorrows, this likewise must be patiently borne. I do not
say these things in reply to you or Viret, but to others who
idly censure us. I seem, moreover, to see your <em>sympathy</em> for
me, so far am I from thinking that you have any hostility
towards me. Adieu, best and most upright brother, along
with your whole family, whom you will affectionately salute
in my name and in that of my wife, as well as all fellow-ministers,
and all the godly.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Consolations on occasion of the Death of one of its Members.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[1547.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messieurs and well-beloved Brethren</span>,&mdash;Although the
present is addressed particularly to two of you,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> I nevertheless
write in such wise, that if you think fit it may serve for the
whole household. If the account which I have heard of the
death of your good brother and mine have been the occasion
of joy to me, as, indeed, there was good reason for it, you who
have known better the whole matter, have, assuredly, far more
ample matter for rejoicing, not for that you have been deprived
of so excellent a companion, on which account both you and I
have good ground for regret&mdash;all the more that the number of
those who in the present day walk constantly in the fear of
God is so small and rare, but because of the singular grace
which God had conferred upon him, of perseverance in the fear
of his name, the faith and patience which he has manifested,
and other tokens of true Christianity. For all that is as a mirror
wherein we may contemplate the strength wherewith our kind
heavenly Father assists his children, and most of all, out of
their greatest difficulties. Then, also, we may conclude that
his death was indeed happy and blessed, in the face of him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of all his angels. At the same time, you must reflect that it is
a fine example for you, lest it be converted into a testimony
against you, to make you inexcusable before God, the great
Judge. For inasmuch as he, dying as a Christian, has shewn
you how you ought to live, it is certain that God would not
have such a testimony to be useless. Know, then, that the
death of your brother is as God's trumpet, whereby he would
call upon you to serve him alone, and this far more loudly
than if your brother had lived ten years longer to exhort you:
while, besides, the pious exhortations which he addressed to
you are ever sounding in your ears, that his zeal may glow in
your hearts, that his earnest and instant prayers may quicken
you, to draw you towards Him to whom he has been gathered
and restored as one of his own. I do not doubt that his expressed
condemnation of the abuses and superstitions which
exist in Christendom, may have given occasion of murmuring
to many, and that it may have somewhat aroused the rage of
the adversaries of the Gospel against the whole family; but it
is not fitting that the plots and threatenings of the wicked
should have more power to discourage our hearts than so
effectual a call from God to uphold us. In short, you must
take heed that the blessing become not an occasion of evil to
you; wherefore, if hitherto ye have begun well, which, indeed,
ought to prove a help to you in going forward, do not slacken,
but rather redouble your ardour, so as to run with greater diligence.
I am not ignorant of the dangers which environ you,
and am not so devoid of fellow-feeling, as not to have that
sympathy which I ought. But you are aware, that will not
excuse such a degree of timidity as there is among those who
mingle in the world, disguising themselves in every way; and
so much the more that there are few who are quite exempt
from it, our duty is to urge and provoke one another forward;
and inasmuch as every one ought to do his utmost to walk
according to the measure of knowledge vouchsafed to him, you
should examine the more narrowly whereunto ye have attained.
For you cannot pretend the common excuse wherewith the most
part cover themselves, as with some moistened rag of a palliative,
namely, that God has not yet bestowed so much grace upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
them. For besides that God has opened your eyes to make
you understand with what zeal you ought to glorify him before
men, above all, the profession you have made obliges you to it
as well. Nought remains, therefore, except that you disencumber
yourself of worldly anxieties, to seek in good earnest
the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. And if it
be not possible to confess him as your Saviour where you are,
you should far rather prefer to be removed for a little while
from the country of your birth, than to be for ever banished from
that immortal inheritance to which we are called. Whether
willingly or no, we must needs be strangers in this world;
shall we then refuse even to stir from the nest? Happy, indeed,
are they who declare, not merely by empty profession,
but effectually, that they are so, and rather than decline from
the faith, are quite ready at once to quit their home, and, in
order to dwell in union with Jesus Christ, make no difficulty
about parting with their earthly comforts. These are hard
sayings to those who have not tasted the worth of Christ; but
to you who have felt his power, all else ought, after the
example of Saint Paul, to be counted but as filth and dung.
Indeed, it is not enough that you yourselves keep steadfast, but
if there be others who are weaker, you ought to strengthen
them by your admonitions, and to look well to it that there
be no falling away.</p>

<p>I myself am far from the dealings of the present time; whether
that will be of long continuance I know not. But I speak of
a thing known and experimentally ascertained. It is a great
shame that with such a measure of knowledge as God has vouchsafed
us, there is so little heart, compared with the ardour of the
martyrs who have gone before us, who were ready to go to death
so soon as God had enlightened them with a far less amount
of understanding. We learn somehow to make shift while we
ought rather to be learning to live; but there are others in
worse plight than we; for, to speak the truth, there are many
who dare not venture to breathe a word, but are content to
dream apart, and to feed upon their fancies, instead of rather
seeking, as they ought, to be continually exercised, as well by
reading together as by conference and godly conversation, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
more to confirm and enkindle holy zeal. I have no reason to
distrust you; but you will pardon my anxiety, which proceeds
from an upright love, if I am moved to warn you in the
name of God, not to let such a blessing be lost, as that which
God has sent to your family; and that you may not lessen it,
take heed to grow in grace; that you may not draw back,
determine to go forward; that you may not come short, resolve
to go on unto perfection.</p>

<p>Wherefore, Messieurs and beloved brethren, after hearty
commendations to all of you who desire the kingdom of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and serve God with a good conscience, I
beseech this kind Father to have you in his protection, and to
make you feel it, so as you may lay hold upon him with such
boldness as should belong to you, that he would guide you by
his Spirit in the obedience of his will, and glorify himself in
you, even unto the end.</p>

<h3>Cost of printing <cite>The Apology</cite>&mdash;despatch of several copies.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>The 24th of January 1548.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Until the return of Sire Nicolas, I shall not
trouble you with long letters, for I expect more ample news by
him. Rest assured, that if I may follow my inclination, please
God I shall not fail to keep my promise.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But seeing that I am
not a free man, I must needs abide the course of events. We
have, God be thanked, another sort of tranquillity than during
the time of billeting. But there is never any season throughout
the year in which I have not my work cut out for me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
more than I could well get through, even although I were a
tolerable tailor.</p>

<p>That which detains me at this time would be explained if I
could only come to you. And, besides, were I to be prevented
by some unlooked for business, Master Peter Viret, who is ready
to supply my place, will explain it to you. But before speaking
of a substitute, we shall see what the Lord will allow.</p>

<p>Concerning the books,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> at the price which I have agreed
upon with the printer, together with what has been paid to the
engraver of the armorial bearings, they will cost you about a
crown the hundred. I gave three florins of Savoy, that is to
say, testons, to the engraver for his trouble; besides which, he
got his victuals. That, with about a teston which it cost him
in returning, is over and above the amount for printing. There
have been eight hundred copies thrown off. I have allowed
the printer to retain a hundred for himself, deducting to that
amount proportionally upon the whole. By this means the
object has been attained of spreading it throughout France. I
have sent away here and there about fifty copies; among others,
one to Madame de Ferrara,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> which, however, need not prevent
you addressing another to her, along with a letter. The seven
hundred, all expenses included, amount to seven crowns. I
believe that René, diligence excepted, will have been faithful.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Monsieur, having commended me affectionately
to your kind favour and that of Madame, and having
also presented to both of you the recommendations of my wife,
I beseech our good Lord to have you always in his keeping,
to guide you by his Spirit, and to increase you in every grace.</p>

<h3>Brotherly explanations regarding the difference on the subject of the Communion.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>1st March 1548</i>.
</p>

<p>I hardly know what prevented me from replying sooner to
you, unless it were that no trustworthy messenger presented
himself who roused me to diligence. But when I heard that the
ambassador of your city was here, I was unwilling to be guilty
of allowing him to depart without a letter from me. I pass
over in silence the long reply in which you seek to wash away all
those points of difference about which I had carefully admonished
you. For of what avail is it for us to enter on a controversy?
I made a note of those points in your book that did not
satisfy myself, or that might prove unsatisfactory to others, or
such as I thought might not meet the approbation of the pious
and learned. I did that at your request. I discharged the
duty of a friend; if you think differently, you are at liberty to
do so, as far as I am concerned. It would certainly not be the
last of my wishes that there should be perfect harmony between
us. But in whatever way I may hold the firm persuasion of a
greater communication of Christ in the Sacraments than you
express in words, we will not, on that account, cease to hold
the same Christ, and to be one in him. Some day, perhaps,
it will be given us to unite in fuller harmony of opinion. I
have always loved ingenuousness, I take no delight in subtleties,
and those who charge others with obscurity, allow me the
merit of perspicuity. Neither, accordingly, can I be charged
with guile, who never artfully affect anything to gain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
favour of men; and my method of instruction is too simple to
admit of any unfavourable suspicion, and too detailed to offend
on the ground of obscurity. Wherefore, if I do not give
uniform satisfaction, indulgence must be extended to me because
I study in good faith, and with perfect candour, openly
to declare what I have to say. It was on this account that
lately, when at Bâle, I felt surprise at your complaint, as a
friend reported to me, that I taught differently in my Commentaries
from what I had held out to you. I replied in one
sentence, which was the truth, that I used the same language
at Zurich as at Geneva. I was, however, disposed to attribute
the whole statement, be it what it might, to the mistake of my
informant. At a time when it was dangerous for me to declare
in language what views I held, I did not turn aside from the
straight line by foregoing the free and firm announcement of
my opinions in every particular, even so far as to bend the
most rigid to some sort of moderation. Why then should I
now, without any necessity, change at once my general mode
of procedure and my convictions? If, however, I fail in persuading
men of the truth of this, I shall be content to have
God as the witness of my confession.</p>

<p>Your ambassador will give you a fuller and more perfect
account of affairs in France than I can compress in a letter.
I wish they were of such a kind as it would give you pleasure
to hear; but there is nothing except sad news daily. Although
he was ordered to abstain from all the abominations of the
Papacy, he could not avoid observing a disgraceful profanation
of the sacred ordinance of baptism.</p>

<p>Adieu, illustrious sir, and highly to be revered brother in
the Lord. You will respectfully salute in my name Masters
Pelliean, Bibliander, Walter, and the other fellow-ministers
and masters of the school. May the Lord Jesus guide you by
his own Spirit, bless your pious labours, and preserve you
safe.</p>

<h2>CCXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Monsieur de Falais.</span></h2>

<h3>Obstacles to his departure&mdash;delay of some months.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>The 3d of April</i> (1548.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>)
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Your letter has arrived just in time to stop
the departure of my brother; for that was a settled matter, if
I had not been informed. But in my opinion the reasons
which detain you where you are, are not of such importance as
you deem them. You see how familiarly I write to you on
this point, and I do not fear to do so, being authorized by yourself.
I had not thought that you would need expressly to renounce
your rights as a burgess,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> although I foresaw clearly
that it would amount to a tacit renunciation when you settled
your domicile in another seigneury. Seeing that there is an
advantage in it, you are right to go thither, unless we could
effect some such arrangement as the following: that even were
you to be longer absent, they should allow you to remain upon
the roll, on condition of your providing a substitute who should
discharge during your absence your duties as a burgess; or
even if there was no hope of that, might you not present a new
request, notwithstanding the reply which they have given you,
to beg of them, that in the event of its suiting your convenience
to remain here, or that after you were come here, it might
not suit you to return, they should be satisfied with your renunciation
by a procurator? But I would state the two conditions
thus: that notwithstanding the reply they have made to
you, inasmuch as you are uncertain when you shall have come
hither, whether you shall think fit to fix your residence here,
you would therefore beg of them, that on condition of your engaging,
as indeed you ought, to supply any deficiency that may
arise owing to your absence, it would please them still to retain
you for some time on the roll of burgesses&mdash;in fact, to grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
an extension of your leave. Or, at the least, fearing to be
troublesome by your importunity, that you pray them to accept
a renunciation by letter, on account of your bodily weakness,
as they are aware that it is not very easy for you to move from
place to place. By so doing, you will remove the suspicion
they may have conceived, that you mean to abandon them
entirely. However it may turn out, I think they will have
good reason to be satisfied. In any case, I never expected that
the rights of a burgess would be long continued to you.</p>

<p>Touching the rumour which your clowns have spread abroad
in order to calumniate you, it scarcely astonishes me. I had
quite laid my account with it, that you would not get away
without many of them letting loose their tongues. And you
must be prepared for that, as well for the other year as for this
one. You have this comfort, however, that it all very soon
goes off in smoke. I am still less alarmed at the threat whispered
in the ear, for it would need great courage to venture on
such a step; and I know not who would dare to be the leader
in an affair of so great difficulty and hazard. In short, I can
perceive no danger for you, according to our arrangement of
each day's journey. But seeing that you think it better to put
it off for some months, and that the advice of some friends is
to that purport, I have no mind to press it further, and would
rather agree to this delay, than by urging you to a contrary
course lead you to incur the risk of mischief or of annoyance.</p>

<p>I know not whether this summer will disclose the councils of
those who may set the world in confusion.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> For my part, I do
not think so, unless some new accident turn up. However, I
do not so much place reliance upon my own conjectures, as I
await the course of events in submission to the will of God.</p>

<p>Although your coming hither may be stayed for a season, it
will be of no consequence as regards the house, for I had concluded
no agreement about it. Only I had purchased a good
cask of wine, such as it would be difficult to get again. But
I have got rid of it without any difficulty, and even as a favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to the purchaser. Therefore it will be for you to consider how
matters go yonder, and thereupon to decide. And do not annoy
yourself lest any one should be offended by your change of
plan, for although all your acquaintances desire much to see
you here, still there is not one of them who does not prefer
your quiet and convenience.</p>

<p>If I could have found a suitable messenger, I would not have
waited so long before sending the complement of the <cite>Apologies</cite>.
But I know not by what means to do so, for up to this time,
no opportunity either of carrier or bearer has occurred. When
I can find one, I shall not fail to do so. About the Latin copies
you have never expressed to me your wish, as far as I know.
Perhaps you would rather defer doing so until your arrival.
Let me know your mind regarding this, if you please, in one
word; if you would have them printed, it shall be done.</p>

<p>To conclude, Monseigneur, having humbly commended me
to your kind favour, I beseech our good Lord to keep you in
his protection, to have such a care of you as that all your steps
may be directed by him, and to make you serviceable always
more and more for his own glory. My wife also presents her
humble commendations, and both of us desire to be remembered
to Madame and to Mademoiselle de Brédan.</p>

<h3>Distressing condition of the Swiss churches.</h3>

<p>My grief prevents me from saying anything of the dreadful
calamity that hangs over so many churches. Michael will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
inform you of what I wrote to Viret. The cause is of such a
nature that no one is to be reckoned among the servants of
Christ who does not come forward boldly in his defence. But
there is need of counsel and some moderation. Should Viret
agree to it, I shall presently hasten to your quarter, that we
three may thence proceed together to Zurich. As to the rest,
Viret and I marvelled as to what decision by arbitration you
referred to; for neither of us has hitherto heard anything of
the matter. I, indeed, assert for certain, that no hint of any
kind was ever given to me. See, therefore, who has undertaken
this business. You will hear the other matters from the
messengers.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and most sincere friend, along with your

salute. May the Lord preserve you all and govern you by his

<h3>Disputes among the ministers of Berne&mdash;and Calvin's journey thither.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>9th May 1548</i>.
</p>

<p>After receiving your last letter, I had set out on my journey;
but meeting the father-in-law of my brother Coppet who told
me that you had left Berne three days before, I returned home
for several reasons, which, if it shall be deemed necessary, I
will detail to you when I see you. Make me now aware of
what you intend to do; for I will straightway execute whatever
you shall demand, without the slightest deliberation. I
have not yet been able to understand the result of your proceedings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Giron and Zerkinden requested greetings to me.
When Nicolas asked whether they had anything to say besides,
he got the answer that there was nothing good. I hence suspect
that the matter is worse than they were willing to
express. Adieu, brethren most dear to me. Both of you
salute the brethren. May God preserve you all, guide you
by his own Spirit, and establish you amid these stormy
troubles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When you, Viret, have read Bucer's letter, you will give it
to the bearer of this that it may be carried to Farel. I have
understood, besides, that Duke Christopher of Wurtemberg,
with his father, has set out for the court of the Emperor. We
thus see that all is in the hand of one. Nevertheless the
Lord will either close it, or wither it, or cut it off, as seems
good to him.</p>

<p>You will say to Farel that I had written to Bucer before his
letter reached me. I send you a copy of a letter to Sulzer. I
have resolved to write to Bullinger and Haller, should I be
permitted and have leisure. This is the reason why I do not
return the letter of Gualter. It is necessary that the threats
of Ludovic form the matter of judicial inquiry by the brethren.
When he shall have been convicted by them, I doubt not but
that he will be proceeded against according to law. I shall
indicate in my next letter, what form of process I think should
be adopted. Adieu, dearest brother in the Lord, and most
sincere friend. I sincerely congratulate you on the safe delivery
of your wife, and the addition to your family.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> I wish that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

<h3>Ecclesiastical tyranny of the Seigneurs of Berne&mdash;sojourn of Idelette de Bure at
Lausanne.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>,] <i>15th June 1548</i>.
</p>

<p>I took care to have a copy of the letter which I wrote to
Bullinger and Haller transcribed for you, in case its contents
should be reported differently from what you may have thought
it proper they should have been; for, as far as I am concerned,
the letter itself contains my opinion to the best of my judgment.
If the reason must be assigned, I not only look to what
is becoming in honourable men, but I further fear that we
may suffer a heavy penalty if, by servile dissimulation, we
strengthen the tyrannical power which barbarous men already
openly usurp. We may serve Jodocus,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and other such beasts,
provided only they form no barrier to our serving Christ; but
when the truth of God is trodden down, woe to our cowardice
if we permit this to be done without protest. It should not
even be tolerated that an innocent man should suffer injury.
At this time, both numerous servants of Christ and his doctrine
itself are assailed. Is it not full time that all the godly, both
collectively and individually, should raise their heads in his
cause? But, nevertheless, that you may come to a free decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
making no account of my pre-judgment of the case, you are
not only permitted, so far as I am concerned, but I even wish
you to give your opinion. Should it seem proper to allow
Farel a reading, I will take care that another copy be sent to
him, that I may receive back the one I send to you.</p>

<p>It is truly a source of pain to me that my wife should have
been so great a burden to you; for she could not have been of
much service to your wife when confined, so far as I can
divine, since she herself, on account of the state of her health,
stood in need of the assiduous attentions of others. It is
matter of comfort to me to be persuaded that you would not
bear it impatiently.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and most sincere friend. May the Lord
guide you, and protect your whole family&mdash;Amen. Yours,</p>

<h2>CCXXIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Henry Bullinger.</span><a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></h2>

<h3>New explanations regarding the Supper&mdash;Violence of some of the Bernese ministers&mdash;Calvinism
and Buceranism.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th June 1548</i>.
</p>

<p>Your letter at length reached me, eight days after I had
arrived at home. Reust was not himself the bearer of it; it
was brought by Roset. The former, I suppose, was less solicitous
about the delivery of it, as he had found a master without
our assistance. We both, however, courteously placed our
services at his disposal. With regard to your small treatise to
which you refer in your letter, I wish, my Bullinger, as we
were lately in your quarter, it had not been troublesome to you
and your colleagues to have talked together in a quiet way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the whole matter. There would assuredly have been some advantage
in this; for I had not come prepared for a stage display,
which is not less disagreeable to myself than it is to you,
to say nothing of Farel, whose disposition you are also aware
is utterly averse from ostentation. But we were anxious to
discuss with you in a familiar way, and with not the least
desire to engage in formal debate, those points with regard to
which we are most nearly at one. And this indeed were the
best method of procedure among brethren, and one we should
have found profitable, unless I am greatly deceived. For with
regard to the Sacraments in general, we neither bind up the
grace of God with them, nor transfer to them the work or
power of the Holy Spirit, nor constitute them the ground of
the assurance of salvation. We expressly declare that it is God
alone, who acts by means of the Sacraments; and we maintain
that their whole efficacy is due to the Holy Spirit, and testify
that this action appears only in the elect. Nor do we teach
that the sacrament is of profit, otherwise than as it leads us by
the hand to Christ, that we may seek in him whatever blessings
there are. I do not in truth see what you can properly desire
as wanting in this doctrine, which teaches that salvation is to
be sought from Christ alone, makes God its sole author, and
asserts that it is accepted only through the secret working of
the Spirit. We teach, however, that the sacraments are instruments
of the grace of God; for, as they were instituted in view
of a certain end, we refuse to allow that they have no proper
use. We therefore say, that what is represented in them, is
exhibited to the elect, lest it should be supposed that God
deludes the eyes by a fallacious representation. Thus we say,
that he who receives baptism with true faith, further receives by
it the pardon of his sins. But lest any one should ascribe his
salvation to baptism as the cause, we at the same time subjoin
the explanation, that the remission flows from the blood of
Christ, and that it is accordingly conferred by baptism only in
so far as this is a testimony of the cleansing which the Son of
God by his own blood shed on the cross procured for us, and
which he offers for your enjoyment by faith in his gospel, and
brings to perfection in our hearts by his Spirit. Our opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
regarding regeneration is precisely similar to that about baptism.
When the signs of the flesh and blood of Christ are spread
before us in the Supper, we say that they are not spread before
us in vain, but that the thing itself is also manifested to us.
Whence it follows, that we eat the body and drink the blood of
Christ. By so speaking, we neither make the sign the thing,
nor confound both in one, nor enclose the body of Christ in the
bread, nor, on the other hand, imagine it to be infinite, nor
dream of a carnal transfusion of Christ into us, nor lay down
any other fiction of that sort. You maintain that Christ, as
to his human nature, is in heaven; we also profess the same
doctrine. The word <em>heaven</em> implies, in your view, distance
of place; we also readily adopt the opinion, that Christ is
undoubtedly distant from us by an interval of place. You
deny that the body of Christ is infinite, but hold that it is
contained within its circumference; we candidly give an
unhesitating assent to that view, and raise a public testimony
in behalf of it. You refuse to allow the sign to be confounded
with the thing; we are sedulous in admonishing
that the one should be distinguished from the other. You
strongly condemn impanation; we subscribe to your decision.
What then is the sum of our doctrine? It is this, that when
we discern here on earth the bread and wine, our minds
must be raised to heaven in order to enjoy Christ, and that
Christ is there present with us, while we seek him above the
elements of this world. For it is not permitted us to charge
Christ with imposition; and that would be the case, unless we
held that the reality is exhibited together with the sign. And
you also concede that the sign is by no means empty. It only
remains that we define what it contains within it. When we
briefly reply, that we are made partakers of the flesh and blood
of Christ that he may dwell in us and we in him, and in this
way enjoy all his benefits, what is there, I ask, in these words
either absurd or obscure, especially as we, in express terms,
exclude whatever delirious fancies might occur to the mind?
And yet we are censured, as if we departed from the pure and
simple doctrine of the Gospel. I should wish, however, to learn
what that simplicity is to which we are to be recalled. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
I was lately with you, I pressed this very point. But you remember,
as I think, that I received no answer. I do not make
this allegation so much by way of complaint, as that I may
publicly testify to the fact that we lie under the suspicion of
certain good men without any ground for it. I have long ago
observed, moreover, that the intercourse we have with Bucer
acts as a dead-weight upon us. But I beseech you, my Bullinger,
to consider with what propriety we should alienate ourselves
from Bucer, seeing he subscribes this very confession which
I have laid down. I shall not at present declare the virtues,
both rare and manifold, by which that man is distinguished.
I shall only say, that I should do a grievous injury to the Church
of God, were I either to hate or despise him. I make no reference
to the personal obligations under which I lie to him. And
yet my love and reverence for him are such, that I freely admonish
him as often as I think fit. How much greater justice
will his complaint regarding you be judged to possess! For he
sometime ago complained that you interdicted youths of Zurich,
who were living at Strasbourg, from partaking of the Supper in
that church, although no confession but your own was demanded
of them. I indeed see no reason why the churches should be
so rent asunder on this point. But what is the reason that
godly men are angry with us, when we cultivate the friendship
of a man who, by himself, professes nothing that can stand in
the way of his being received as a friend and a brother? As
the matter hinges on this, shew me, if you can, that by my
friendly intercourse with Bucer I am restrained in the free profession
of my views. I may perhaps seem to be so, but I make
the thing itself the test of the truth. Wherefore, let us not be
so suspicious where there is no call for it. As to the other
matters, when I had come to Lausanne I counselled the brethren
to send as soon as possible to Haller, for I had the hope they
would obtain from him all that was just; and in this expectation
I was not disappointed. Jodocus, however, and Ebrard,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
what brother of the giants I know not, who had been sent, were
so grossly violent in their invectives, that they were presently
compelled to betake themselves [home]. So great a source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
indignation was my proceeding to Zurich, as if, forsooth, I had
no right to be affected by the danger of a church so near us,
or to seek a suitable remedy in conjunction with the brethren.
Jodocus said, in a threatening way, that he knew what I had
done when with you. I boasted, however, that I had been a
party to no transaction that was unworthy of my reputation as
an honourable man. But why should I recount to you the insolence
and scurrilities of both of them? Take this as the sum
of the matter, that the two brethren, both eminently learned,
grave, and judicious, were so astounded, that they thought it
best to make a seasonable departure. Such is brotherly clemency.
It is, however, worth while to make a brief statement,
that you may form a judgment of the matter from the beginning
to the end. Immediately on our first meeting, in place of
salutation, it was asked, Who raised these tragical commotions?
When it was said, in reply, that they were known to have proceeded
from Zebedee, Ebrard exclaimed, 'Yes, that good man
is unworthily traduced by you, because he laid bare your stratagems.'
On the brethren requesting those stratagems to be
explained to them; 'We have,' he says, 'a Bernese disputation
from which we form our judgment of you and all your affairs.'
I beseech thee, my Bullinger, to say whether such is the case.
What have we profited by shaking off the tyranny of the Pope?
Observe, also, how suitable was the interrogation of Jodocus,
who had asked me to form one of the assembly at Lausanne?
Finally, that the last part of the proceedings might be of a piece
with the first, the brethren were ordered to go away, and have
done with their Calvinism and Buceranism. And all this with
an impetuosity almost like madmen, and outrageous clamours.
Could you expect anything more unfeeling or truculent from
Papists? Though we may patiently tolerate this intemperate
Bacchantism, the Lord, nevertheless, will not suffer it to pass
unpunished. At Paris and in many parts of the kingdom, the
ferocity of the ungodly is inflamed afresh. The King himself
holds on in his fury. Thus is fulfilled the prediction, Without
fightings, within fears; although Jodocus excites not only fears
within, but open fightings. But may the very fewness of our
numbers incite us to an alliance!</p>

<h3>Preparations for the marriage of Mademoiselle de Wilergy, his relation.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 17th of July</i> [1548.]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I believe that it will be best as it is. If it
had been possible to speak together about the contract,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> I would
have much desired to do so; but I do not know whether you
will be able to come this week. However, the man offers, in
case he should leave his wife a widow without children that she
shall have a thousand crowns. In the event of his leaving children,
she shall have the half, but on condition that, if she
marry afterwards, and have also children by the second marriage,
she must not have the power of preferring them to those
of the first. The present assignment will be founded upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
instrument of Paris, to be implemented, when he shall have
made good his money and expenses. I am of opinion that
his offer is very liberal; for it is quite right that the husband
retain some control in his own hand.</p>

<p>The wedding, I hope, will go off well. There must needs be
some company, but no great multitude. And besides, we must
not be too hard upon you, for it will be necessary to find lodgings
for them. I think ten persons will be a reasonable number,
including myself. And seeing that my brother is not here
at present, I know not whether we could send notice by letter
to Dôle and to Basle. Perhaps, indeed, we might, if they
should be here for the whole day to-morrow.</p>

<p>I had forgotten to mention the French traveller;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> that is, to
tell you that I do not find him in any hurry; and yet that is
not by any means because all is not quite clear about him, but
for the purpose of seeking some advantage over and above. I
wish very much that it may please God to bring you hither to
drink of the wine upon the spot, and that soon. If the bearer
had left this earlier in the morning, you might have had a flask
of it. If there were any means of sending you the half of it,
I should not have failed to do so, but when I inquired, I found
that it could not be done.</p>

<p>And so, Monsieur, having commended me to your kind
favour, and that of Madame and your whole household, I beseech
our Lord to have you in his keeping.</p>

<h2>CCXXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Farel.</span></h2>

<h3>Uncertainty regarding the disposition of the Cantons&mdash;stay of Monsieur and Madame
de Falais in Calvin's house.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>,] <i>27th August 1548</i>.
</p>

<p>I have no doubt, even although you do not expostulate with
me, that you silently condemn me for neglect in having suffered
so many bearers to depart for you without my letter. If
I were to plead that there was nothing to write about, you
would at once confute me. Even though matter for correspondence
is never wanting, I permit myself to indulge in
silence, when there is nothing pressing. We are waiting to
find whether the Swiss will suffer themselves to be circumvented
by the artifices of Ulysses. May the Lord look to this,
on whose Providence it is fitting we should lean;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> since reason
does not guide the helm, and we know that fortune has no
dominion. As far as can be divined, [their policy is as follows:]
As on the one hand the Emperor will seek to deceive them by
fair words, so they in their turn will keep him in suspense
until they have seen that they are protected by those defences
which they deem necessary. Here we are occupied in the usual
way, but the skirmishes are slight. Unless I am wholly deceived
in my conjectures, either some disturbances will speedily
arise, or this winter cause suffering to the great crowds in
many places. Good Toussain<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> is not grieved by the matter.
To his other troubles is added the disease of his son. You
will therefore use your influence with Peter the surgeon to get
him to repair to that quarter, in case some means of alleviation
may be discovered. We shall see about William; we have
talked among ourselves regarding him. But as Allen and San
Privat are present, we have as yet come to no determination.
The godly man offers no objection, but I am unwilling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
send him away for no end. He will also return to Lausanne
before he undertakes this journey. If you have found a trustworthy
messenger, I wish you would send to me what letters
of mine you have in your possession. Viret is to do the same.
I shall send them back, with certain marks, if there be any
which it is not expedient all should read. I shall send each of
you his own, when I am at liberty to do so, that you may add
similar marks. I will take care that these are subjoined. I
have not yet seen Christopher. M. de Falais is now with me,
who I trust will pass the winter here.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> I have caused him to
cast away the unfavourable doubt regarding you, which he had
conceived from your conversation. The more he loves you
and defers to you, the more anxious was he that you should
judge aright of his piety. But it is in truth as you say: when
you demanded of him what you thought would be for the
edification of the Church, he suspected that you desiderated
in him the very thing you sought for, as if he had not manifested
it hitherto. Both [Monsieur and Madame de Falais]
very affectionately salute you, as also my colleagues; and my
wife, who is in bed from prolonged illness. I have been
struggling these days past with pain in the head, and spasms
of the stomach, to such a degree as to cause violent convulsions.
Adieu, brother and most sincere friend, along with
your family and brothers, especially my guest Fato, to whom
I will send back the token of friendship, unless he sometime
visit us.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Embarrassment occasioned to Calvin by the treacherous publication of one of his
letters to Viret.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>,] <i>20th September 1548</i>.
</p>

<p>I was within a little of letting our friend Merlin depart without
a letter. When he was already equipped for the journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he sacrificed for me the time between sermon and supper; the
half of which period I spent in conversation with some people.
With regard to a successor to Himbert, I have scarcely ground
for giving an advice. I see indeed the dangers that are imminent,
unless some one be put in his place as soon as possible.
I do not observe among you any one who pleases me in every
respect. You cannot call from a distance any but unknown
men. Our choice is accordingly restricted to those in whom
you may have to desiderate something as wanting; only let it
not be piety and a moderate acquaintance with the language,&mdash;qualifications
that are to be regarded as the chief. But if you
make choice of any one with this reservation, that he is not to
be under obligation to remain in the office, should anything
more suitable shortly afterwards present itself, you will take
care expressly to state this to the person himself, and to the
senate. When I became aware that the letter, obtained surreptitiously
and translated into French by Trolliet, was being circulated,
and that oil was thus poured on the flame, I came into
the council chamber, and pointed out the injustice of those devices,
the danger of such procedure to the Church, and the evil
precedent it afforded. That person was summoned; he appeared
in the midst of the meeting; I acknowledged my hand, and then
made such an apology as the circumstances demanded. We were
thus suffered to go home. A resolution, however, was come to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
that I should be again summoned after the following Monday.
This has not been done. What has prevented it I know not,
unless, as I suspect, it be the stratagem of the ungodly to afford
them a weapon for the purpose of injuring me, as often as it shall
be advantageous for them to employ it. For the council was
disposed to allow the whole matter to pass into oblivion. Accordingly,
if at any time I have stood in need of your help, you
now see that I especially require it. For I shall not be able to
urge you without a confession of fear. But if you repair hither,
and complain of the injury done to you,&mdash;if you then add that
you do not deserve at the hands of the republic to have a letter
that was stolen from you retained,&mdash;if finally you demand its
restoration, and moreover signify that you need it for the conviction
of the thief,&mdash;I do not think it will be difficult to obtain
it. Do you now consider whether another course is more expedient.
The whole council is censured in the letter. For the
time is described when Corna resigned the office of treasurer.
I next mention those whom the people then created syndics,
and who were allured into the council. Then follow finally
the best things they wish to be expected of them. I know not
what I ought to expect. For under pretext of Christ they mean
to reign without Christ; since among them are reckoned Amy
Curtet, and Dominic Arlo, who are now in prison, until they
shall have discharged the debts due by them to the public
treasury. Perrin, with his friends, goes to them, and urges
them to become reconciled to me. Others also solicit this.
Last of all, they omit no wickedness by which they may overthrow
me. I partly dissemble, and partly openly profess that all
their efforts are held by me in derision. For they would think
they had obtained the victory, if they observe in me any token
[of fear.] Nor indeed is there anything that is more fitted to
break the force of their impetuosity, and animate good men in
sustaining the cause, than my self-reliance. If you are not at
liberty to come shortly, consider whether it be not expedient to
write. But I should not wish you to do so, unless by a sure
messenger, and one who should have a commission requiring an
answer. Adieu, brother, and most sincere friend, along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
your wife and young daughter. Respectfully salute the brethren.
My wife also salutes you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h2>CCXXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To a French Seigneur.</span><a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></h2>

<h3>Exhortation to come to Geneva, that he might there serve the Lord faithfully.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 18th of October 1548.</i>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;I have partly been informed of your intention
by the Sieur François de la Rivière, and praise our Lord for
the good courage he has given you to serve him fully. As
we ought to yield ourselves up to him entirely and without
reserve, if we desire to be approved as his, you must now ascertain
how you can employ yourself as is your duty in his service.
It is true that the earth is the Lord's, and that we are
at liberty to dwell in any part of it, provided we take care to
keep ourselves unpolluted, to honour him in our body as well
as our spirit. When we are told that the whole earth is holy,
we are thereby admonished, that we ought in nowise to defile
it by leading a sinful life. You must now take good heed, that
by concealing as you are doing the light that is in you, you do
not make yourself a partaker in the pollutions which you very
properly condemn in unbelievers. I fully believe, that your
heart is very far from consenting thereto; but in making the
outward show of communicating, there can be no doubt that
you thereby make a profession of consenting to it. And as
before God we ought to manifest our detestation of idolatry, so
also before men, we ought to abstain from whatsoever may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
make it appear that we approve thereof. It is surely right that
the body be kept quite pure for the service of God, as well as
the soul, seeing that it is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and
has the promise of the immortal glory which shall be revealed
at the last day. But is it possible to employ body and soul
with sincerity of heart in the service of God, while we make
a semblance of agreement with idolaters, in an act which we
know to be dishonouring to God? It is not enough to reply
to this, that you make no oral declaration, indeed, that you
would be ready to protest the contrary, were you required to
do so, for you are well aware that you go thither with no other
intention, than that of leading God's enemies to believe that
you do not repudiate their doings, for if it was not for the
sake of gratifying them, and by such means shrinking from
the declaration, that you are utterly opposed to their sacrileges,
you never would join them in an act of worship. And
that is nothing else than rendering a feigned homage to their
idol, albeit without the homage of the heart. If it seems to
you that I am too severe in dealing with your faults so narrowly,
I ask you to enter upon the work of self-examination,
and you will find, that I bring forward nothing against you,
whereof your own conscience does not reprove you. Judge,
then, whether God does not see there much more to find fault
with, for he sees our state far more clearly than we ourselves
do. Therefore, I cannot, consistently with the understanding
which God has vouchsafed me, advise a Christian man to continue
in such a state; and can only say, that to my thinking
he is truly happy who is free from such constraint. Whosoever,
therefore, has the means of withdrawing from it, ought not in
my opinion on any account to neglect to do so. True it is, that
never shall man have things so entirely to his mind, that he
shall be exempted from difficulty, but, on the contrary, must
expect many annoyances, even wrong and loss of property.
But let us learn to prefer the honour of God to all things else.
In your case, I understand that your merciful God has already
brought you so far, that you are resolved not to stagnate in a
place where you knowingly offend him. Wherefore, I forbear
from any more lengthened exhortations; only, be careful not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to quench that zeal which he has vouchsafed you, but rather
stir it up as a remembrancer to keep you in mind to carry out
your good intention. For I know well, and experience will
convince you, how many distractions there are to make you
forgetful of it, or so far to delay that you might grow cool
about it. Regarding the alternatives which Sire François has
set before me, I have told him what to give you as my opinion.
However, your departure must be like that out of Egypt, bringing
all your effects along with you. For all this, I believe you
will need steadfast and very determined courage. But you are
able to do all in Him who strengthens you. When he has
brought you hither, you shall see how he will guide you farther.
For my part, I would gladly help thereunto cheerfully
and steadily, as bound I am to do. I am confident, that after
leading you by the hand in greater things, he will not fail you
on this occasion. But he is sometimes pleased to exercise and
try our faith, so that while quitting hold of that which is within
our grasp, we know not what we shall receive in place of it.
We have an example of this in our father Abraham. After
having commanded him to forsake his country, his kindred,
and everything else, he shewed him no present reward, but put
that off to another time. "Get thee out," said he, "into the
land which I shall shew thee." Should it please him at this
time to do the like with us, that we must quit the land of our
birth, and betake ourselves into an unknown country, without
knowing how it may fare with us there, let us surrender ourselves
to him, that he may direct our way, and let us honour
him, by trusting that he will steer us to a safe harbour. It
is needful, at least, that you be informed beforehand that you
shall enter here no earthly paradise, where you may rejoice in
God without molestation: you will find a people unmannerly
enough; you will meet with some sufficiently annoying trials.
In short, do not expect to better your condition, except in so
far, that having been delivered from miserable bondage of body
and of soul, you will have leave to serve God faithfully. You
will have the pure doctrine of the Word, you will call upon
his name in the fellowship of faithful men, you will enjoy the
true use of the sacraments. But that may well be all in all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
us, if we only prize it as we ought. As for other comforts,
you will take those which God vouchsafes to you, willingly
suffering the want of those which he denies. Make up your
mind, then, to follow Jesus Christ, without flying from the
cross; and indeed you would gain nothing by trying to avoid
it, because it will assuredly find you out. But let us be content
with this invaluable blessing, that we are allowed to live
not only in peace of conscience, but daily to exercise ourselves
in the doctrine of salvation, and in the use of the sacraments,
for our confirmation. He who builds on this foundation, shall
rear a solid edifice, and in truth you cannot evidence whether
you do value Jesus Christ or not, unless by reckoning all the
world as filth in comparison of him.</p>

<p>To conclude, having recommended me affectionately to your
kind favour, I beseech our good Lord to fill you with the
spirit of counsel and discretion, to discern what will be right
and fitting for you to do, and to strengthen you in true constancy,
to put in practice whatsoever shall be according to his
will; that having done so, it may please him to lead you by
the hand, to bless you in going out and coming in, to turn all
into godly prosperity.</p>

<p>Your humble brother and servant in our Lord,</p>

<h3>Duties imposed on the Protector by the high office which he holds&mdash;plan of a complete

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>22d October 1548</i>.
</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Although God has endowed you with singular
prudence, largeness of mind, and other virtues required in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
station wherein he has set you, and for the affairs which he
has put into your hand; nevertheless, inasmuch as you deem
me to be a servant of his Son, whom you desire above all else
to obey, I feel assured, that for the love of him you will receive
with courtesy, that which I write in his name, as indeed I
have no other end in view, save only, that in following out yet
more and more what you have begun, you may advance his
honour, until you have established his kingdom in as great
perfection as is to be looked for in the world. And you will
perceive likewise as you read, that without advancing anything
of my own, the whole is drawn from his own pure doctrine.
Were I to look merely at the dignity and grandeur of your
position, there would seem no access whatever for a man of my
quality. But since you do not refuse to be taught of the
Master whom I serve, but rather prize above all else the grace
which he has bestowed in numbering you among his disciples,
methinks I have no need to make you any long excuse or preface,
because I deem you well disposed to receive whatsoever
proceeds from him.</p>

<p>We have all reason to be thankful to our God and Father,
that he has been pleased to employ you in so excellent a work
as that of setting up the purity and right order of his worship
in England by your means, and establishing the doctrine of
salvation, that it may there be faithfully proclaimed to all those
who shall consent to hear it; that he has vouchsafed you such
firmness and constancy to persevere hitherto, in spite of so
many trials and difficulties; that he has helped you with his
mighty arm, in blessing all your counsels and your labours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to make them prosper. These are grounds of thankfulness
which stir up all true believers to magnify his name. Seeing
however, that Satan never ceases to upheave new conflicts, and
that it is a thing in itself so difficult, that nothing can be more
so, to cause the truth of God to have peaceable dominion among
men, who by nature are most prone to falsehood; while, on the
other hand, there are so many circumstances which prevent its
having free course; and most of all, that the superstitions of
Antichrist, having taken root for so long time, cannot be easily
uprooted from men's hearts,&mdash;you have much need, methinks,
to be confirmed by holy exhortations. I cannot doubt, indeed,
that you have felt this from experience; and shall therefore
deal all the more frankly with you, because, as I hope, my deliberate
opinion will correspond with your own desire. Were
my exhortations even uncalled for, you would bear with the
zeal and earnestness which has led me to offer them. I believe,
therefore, that the need of them which you feel, will make them
all the more welcome. However this may be, Monseigneur,
may it please you to grant me audience in some particular reformations
which I propose to lay here briefly before you, in
the hope, that when you shall have listened to them, you will
at least find some savour of consolation therein, and feel the
more encouraged to prosecute the holy and noble enterprise
in which God has hitherto been pleased to employ you.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the great troubles which have fallen out
for some time past, must have been very severe and annoying
to you, and especially as many may have found in them occasion
of offence; forasmuch as they were partly excited under cover
of the change of religion. Wherefore you must necessarily have
felt them very keenly, as well on account of the apprehensions
they may have raised in your mind, as of the murmurs of the
ignorant or disaffected, and also of the alarm of the well-disposed.
Certes, the mere rumour which I heard from afar,
caused me heartfelt anxiety, until I was informed that God had
begun to apply a remedy thereto. However, since perhaps they
are not yet entirely allayed, or seeing that the devil may have
kindled them anew, it will be well that you call to mind what
the sacred history relates of good King Hezekiah, (2 Chron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
xxxii.,) namely, that after he had abolished the superstitions
throughout Judea, reformed the state of the church according
to the law of God, he was even then so pressed by his enemies,
that it almost seemed as if he was a lost and ruined man. It
is not without reason that the Holy Spirit pointedly declares,
that such an affliction happened to him immediately after having
re-established the true religion in his realm; for it may well
have seemed reasonable to himself, that having striven with
all his might to set up the reign of God, he should have
peace within his own kingdom. Thus, all faithful princes and
governors of countries are forewarned by that example, that
however earnest they may be in banishing idolatry and in promoting
the true worship of God, their faith may yet be tried by
diverse temptations. So God permits, and wills it to be thus,
to manifest the constancy of his people, and to lead them to
look above the world. Meanwhile, the devil also does his work,
endeavouring to ruin sound doctrine by indirect means, working
as it were underground, forasmuch as he could not openly
attain his end. But according to the admonition of St. James,
(James v. 11,) who tells us, that in considering the patience of
Job, we must look to the end of it, so ought we, Monseigneur, to
look to the end which was vouchsafed to this good king. We
see there that God was a present help in all his perplexities,
and that at length he came off victorious. Wherefore, seeing
that his arm is not shortened, and that, in the present day, he
has the defence of the truth and the salvation of his own as
much at heart as ever, never doubt that he will come to your
aid, and that not once only, but in all the trials he may send
you.</p>

<p>If the majority of the world oppose the Gospel, and even
strive with rage and violence to hinder its progress, we ought
not to think it strange. It proceeds from the ingratitude of men,
which has always shewn itself, and ever will, in drawing back
when God comes near, and even in kicking against him when
he would put his yoke upon them. More than that, because
by nature they are wholly given to hypocrisy, they cannot bear
to be brought to the clear light of the word of God, which lays
bare their baseness and shame, nor to be drawn forth out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
their superstitions, which serve them as a hiding-hole and shady
covert. It is nothing new, then, if we meet with contradiction
when we attempt to lead men back to the pure worship of God.
And we have, besides, the clear announcement of our Lord
Jesus, who tells us that he has brought a sword along with his
Gospel. But let not this daunt us, nor make us shrink and be
fearful, for at last, when men shall have rebelled most stoutly,
and vomited forth all their rage, they shall be put to confusion
in a moment, and shall destroy themselves by the fury of their
own onset. That is a true saying, in the second Psalm, that God
shall only laugh at their commotion; that is to say, that seeming
to connive, he will let them bluster, as if the affair did not
at all concern him. But it always happens, that at length they
are driven back by his power, wherewith if we be armed, we
have a sure and invincible munition, whatsoever plots the devil
may frame against us, and shall know by experience in the end,
that even as the Gospel is the message of peace and of reconciliation
between God and us, it will also avail us to pacify men;
and in this way we shall understand, that it is not in vain that
Isaiah has said, (Is. ii. 4,) that when Jesus Christ shall rule in
the midst of us by his doctrine, the swords shall be turned into
ploughshares, and the spears into pruning-hooks.</p>

<p>Albeit, however, the wickedness and opposition of men may
be the cause of the sedition and rebellion which rises up against
the Gospel, let us look to ourselves, and acknowledge that God
chastises our faults by those who would otherwise serve Satan
only. It is an old complaint, that the Gospel is the cause of
all the ills and calamities that befall mankind. We see, in
fact, from history, that shortly after Christianity had been everywhere
spread abroad, there was not, so to speak, a corner of the
earth which was not horribly afflicted. The uproar of war, like
a universal fire, was kindled in all lands. Land-floods on the
one hand, and famine and pestilence on the other, a chaotic
confusion of order and civil polity to such a degree, that it
seemed as if the world was presently about to be overturned.
In like manner we have seen in our times, since the Gospel has
begun to be set up, much misery; to such an extent, indeed,
that every one complains we are come upon an unhappy period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and there are very few who do not <em>groan</em> under this burden.
While, then, we feel the blow, we ought to look upward to the
hand of Him who strikes, and ought also to consider why the
blow is sent. The reason why he makes us thus to feel his
rod is neither very obscure nor difficult to be understood. We
know that the word, by which he would guide us to salvation,
is an invaluable treasure; with what reverence do we receive it
when he presents it to us? Seeing, then, that we make no
great account of that which is so precious, God has good reason
to avenge himself of our ingratitude. We hear also what
Jesus Christ announces, (Luke xii. 47,) that the servant knowing
the will of his Master, and not doing it, deserves double
chastisement. Since, therefore, we are so remiss in obeying the
will of our God, who has declared it to us more than a hundred
times already, let us not think it strange if his anger rage
more severely against us, seeing that we are all the more inexcusable.
When we do not cultivate the good seed, there is
much reason that the thorns and thistles of Satan should spring
up to trouble and annoy us. Since we do not render to our
Creator the submission which is due to him, it is no wonder
that men rise up against us.</p>

<p>From what I am given to understand, Monseigneur, there
are two kinds of rebels who have risen up against the King and
the Estates of the Kingdom. The one, a fantastical sort of
persons, who, under colour of the Gospel, would put all into
confusion. The others are persons who persist in the superstitions
of the Roman Antichrist. Both alike deserve to be repressed
by the sword which is committed to you, since they not
only attack the King, but strive with God, who has placed him
upon a royal throne, and has committed to you the protection
as well of his person as of his majesty. But the chief point is,
to endeavour, as much as possible, that those who have some
savour of a liking for the doctrine of the Gospel, so as to hold
fast, should receive it with such humility and godly fear, as to
renounce self in order to serve God; for they ought seriously to
consider that God would awaken them all, so that in good earnest
they may profit far more from his word than they have
ever yet done. These madmen, who would have the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
world turned back into a chaos of licentiousness, are hired by
Satan to defame the Gospel, as if it bred nothing but revolt
against princes, and all sorts of disorder in the world. Wherefore,
all the faithful ought to be deeply grieved. The Papists, in
endeavouring to maintain the corruptions and abominations of
their Romish idol, shew themselves to be the open enemies of the
grace of Jesus Christ, and of all his ordinances. That ought
likewise to occasion great sickness at heart among all those who
have a single drop of godly zeal. And therefore they ought every
one of them earnestly to consider, that these are the rods of God
for their correction. And wherefore? Just because they do not
set a proper value on the doctrine of salvation. Herein lies the
chief remedy for the silencing of such calumnies, that those
who make profession of the Gospel be indeed renewed after
the image of God, so as to make manifest that our Christianity
does not occasion any interruption of the humanities of social
life, and to give good evidence, by their temperance and moderation,
that being governed by the word of God, we are not
unruly people subject to no restraint, and so by an upright holy
life shut the mouth of all the evil speakers. For by this means
God, being pacified, shall withdraw his hand, and instead of,
as at this day, punishing the contempt with which they have
treated his word, he will reward their obedience with all prosperity.
It would be well were all the nobility and those who
administer justice, to submit themselves, in uprightness and all
humility, to this great king, Jesus Christ, paying him sincere
homage, and with faith unfeigned, in body, soul, and spirit, so
that he may correct and beat down the arrogance and rashness
of those who would rise up against them. Thus ought earthly
princes to rule and govern, serving Jesus Christ, and taking
order that he may have his own sovereign authority over all,
both small and great. Wherefore, Monseigneur, as you hold
dear and in regard the estate of your royal nephew, as indeed
you shew plainly that you do, I beseech you, in the name of
God, to apply your chief care and watchfulness to this end,
that the doctrine of God may be proclaimed with efficacy and
power, so as to produce its fruit, and never to grow weary,
whatsoever may happen, in following out fully, an open and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
complete reformation of the Church. The better to explain to
you what I mean, I shall arrange the whole under three heads.</p>

<p>The first shall treat of the sound instruction of the people;
the second shall regard the rooting out of abuses which have
prevailed hitherto; the third, the careful repression and correction
of vice, and to take strict heed that scandals and loose
conversation may not grow into a fashion, so as to cause the
name of God to be blasphemed.</p>

<p>As concerning the first article, I do not mean to pronounce
what doctrine ought to have place. Rather do I offer thanks
to God for his goodness, that after having enlightened you in
the pure knowledge of himself, he has given you wisdom and
discretion to take measures that his pure truth may be
preached. Praise be to God, you have not to learn what is the
true faith of Christians, and the doctrine which they ought to
hold, seeing that by your means the true purity of the faith has
been restored. That is, that we hold God alone to be the sole
Governor of our souls, that we hold his law to be the only
rule and spiritual directory for our consciences, not serving
him according to the foolish inventions of men. Also, that
according to his nature he would be worshipped in spirit and
in purity of heart. On the other hand, acknowledging that
there is nothing but all wretchedness in ourselves, and that we
are corrupt in all our feelings and affections, so that our souls
are a very abyss of iniquity, utterly despairing of ourselves;
and that, having exhausted every presumption of our own
wisdom, worth, or power of well-doing, we must have recourse
to the fountain of every blessing, which is in Christ Jesus,
accepting that which he confers on us, that is to say, the merit
of his death and passion, that by this means we may be reconciled
to God; that being washed in his blood, we may have
no fear lest our spots prevent us from finding grace at the
heavenly throne; that being assured that our sins are pardoned
freely in virtue of his sacrifice, we may lean, yea rest, upon
that for assurance of our salvation; that we may be sanctified
by his Spirit, and so consecrate ourselves to the obedience of
the righteousness of God; that being strengthened by his grace,
we may overcome Satan, the world, and the flesh; finally, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
being members of his body, we may never doubt that God
reckons us among the number of his children, and that we
may confidently call upon him as <em>our</em> Father; that we may be
careful to recognize and bear in mind this purpose in whatsoever
is said or done in the Church, namely, that being separated
from the world, we should rise to heaven with our Head
and Saviour. Seeing then that God has given you grace to
re-establish the knowledge of this doctrine, which had been so
long buried out of sight by Antichrist, I forbear from entering
further on the subject.</p>

<p>What I have thus suggested as to the manner of instruction,
is only that the people be so taught as to be touched to the
quick, and that they may feel that what the Apostle says is true,
(Heb. iv.) that "the word of God is a two-edged sword, piercing
even through the thoughts and affections to the very marrow of
the bones." I speak thus, Monseigneur, because it appears to
me that there is very little preaching of a lively kind in the
kingdom, but that the greater part deliver it by way of reading
from a written discourse. I see very well the necessity which
constrains you to that; for in the first place you have not, as I
believe, such well-approved and competent pastors as you desire.
Wherefore, you need forthwith to supply this want. Secondly,
there may very likely be among them many flighty persons
who would go beyond all bounds, sowing their own silly fancies,
as often happens on occasion of a change. But all these considerations
ought not to hinder the ordinance of Jesus Christ
from having free course in the preaching of the Gospel. Now,
this preaching ought not to be lifeless but lively, to teach, to
exhort, to reprove, as Saint Paul says in speaking thereof to
Timothy, (2 Tim. iii.) So indeed, that if an unbeliever enter,
he may be so effectually arrested and convinced, as to give
glory to God, as Paul says in another passage, (1 Cor. xiv.)
You are also aware, Monseigneur, how he speaks of the lively
power and energy with which they ought to speak, who would
approve themselves as good and faithful ministers of God, who
must not make a parade of rhetoric, only to gain esteem for
themselves; but that the Spirit of God ought to sound forth by
their voice, so as to work with mighty energy. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
may be the amount of danger to be feared, that ought not to
hinder the Spirit of God from having liberty and free course
in those to whom he has given grace for the edifying of the
Church.</p>

<p>True it is, nevertheless, that it is both right and fitting to
oppose the levity of some fantastic minds, who allow themselves
in too great license, and also to shut the door against all eccentricities
and new doctrines; but the method to be taken, which
God hath pointed out to us, for dealing with such occurrences,
is well fitted to dispose of them. In the first place, there ought
to be an explicit summary of the doctrine which all ought to
preach, which all prelates and curates swear to follow, and no
one should be received to any ecclesiastical charge who does not
promise to preserve such agreement. Next, that they have a
common <em>formula</em> of instruction for little children and for ignorant
persons, serving to make them familiar with sound doctrine, so
that they may be able to discern the difference between it and
the falsehood and corruptions which may be brought forward in
opposition to it. Believe me, Monseigneur, the Church of God
will never preserve itself without a Catechism, for it is like the
seed to keep the good grain from dying out, and causing it to
multiply from age to age. And therefore, if you desire to build
an edifice which shall be of long duration, and which shall not
soon fall into decay, make provision for the children being instructed
in a good Catechism, which may shew them briefly,
and in language level to their tender age, wherein true Christianity
consists. This Catechism will serve two purposes, to
wit, as an introduction to the whole people, so that every one
may profit from what shall be preached, and also to enable them
to discern when any presumptuous person puts forward strange
doctrine. Indeed, I do not say that it may not be well, and even
necessary, to bind down the pastors and curates to a certain
written form, as well for the sake of supplementing the ignorance
and deficiencies of some, as the better to manifest the conformity
and agreement between all the churches; thirdly, to
take away all ground of pretence for bringing in any eccentricity
or new-fangled doctrine on the part of those who only seek
to indulge an idle fancy; as I have already said, the Catechism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ought to serve as a check upon such people. There is, besides,
the form and manner of administration of the sacraments; also
the public prayers. But whatever, in the meantime, be the
arrangement in regard to these matters, care must be taken not
to quench the efficacy which ought to attend the preaching of
the Gospel. And the utmost care should be taken, that so far
as possible you have good trumpets, which shall sound into the
very depths of the heart. For there is some danger that you
may see no great profit from all the reformation which you shall
have brought about, however sound and godly it may have been,
unless this powerful instrument of preaching be developed more
and more. It is not said without a meaning, that <em>Jesus Christ
shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the
breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked</em>, (Is. xi. 4.) The way
by which he is pleased to subdue us is, by destroying whatsoever
is contrary to himself. And herein you may also perceive
why the Gospel is called the Kingdom of God. Even so, albeit
the edicts and statutes of princes are good helps for advancing
and upholding the state of Christianity, yet God is pleased to
declare his sovereign power by this spiritual sword of his
word, when it is made known by the pastors.</p>

<p>Not to tire you, Monseigneur, I shall now come to the
second point which I propose to touch upon; that is, the abolition
and entire uprooting of the abuses and corruptions which
Satan had aforetime mixed up with the ordinances of God. We
wot well that under the Pope there is a bastard sort of Christianity,
and that God will disavow it at the last day, seeing that
he now condemns it by his word. If we desire to rescue the
world from such an abyss, there is no better method than to
follow the example of St. Paul, who, wishing to correct what
the Corinthians had improperly added to the Supper of our
Lord, tells them, (1 Cor. xi.) <em>I have received of the Lord that
which I have delivered to you</em>. Thence we are bound to take
a general instruction, to return to the strict and natural meaning
of the commandment of God, if we would have a sound
reformation and by him approven. For whatsoever mixtures
men have brought in of their own devising, have been just so
many pollutions which turn us aside from the sanctified use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
what God has bestowed for our salvation. Therefore, to lop off
such abuses by halves will by no means restore things to a state
of purity, for then we shall always have a dressed-up Christianity.
I say this, because there are some who, under pretence
of moderation, are in favour of sparing many abuses, without
meddling with them at all, and to whom it appears enough to
have rooted out the principal one. But on the contrary, we see
how fertile is the seed of falsehood, and that only a single grain
is needed to fill the world with them in three days' time, to such
an extent are men inclined and addicted thereto. Our Lord
teaches quite another method of procedure, for when David
speaks of the idols, he says, (Psalm xvi.,) <em>Their names will I not
take up into my lips</em>, to intimate in what degree of detestation
we ought to hold them. Above all, if we consider how we have
offended God in the days of our ignorance, we ought to feel
doubly bound to flee from the inventions of Satan, which have
led us into the commission of evil, as from baits which serve
only to seduce souls. On the other hand, we see, even when
we remonstrate with men about their faults and errors, though
we warn them as earnestly as possible, they are nevertheless so
hardened that we can produce no effect. If, therefore, we were
to leave them any remnant of abuse, that would only serve to
nourish their obstinacy the more, and become a veil to darken
all the doctrine which we might set before them. I willingly
acknowledge that we must observe moderation, and that overdoing
is neither discreet nor useful; indeed, that forms of worship
need to be accommodated to the condition and tastes of the
people. But the corruptions of Satan and of Antichrist must
not be admitted under that pretext. Therefore it is that Holy
Scripture, when praising those kings who had cast down the
idols and their worshippers, not having swept them entirely
away, notes it as a blemish, that nevertheless they had not cast
down the chapelries and places of silly devotion. Wherefore,
Monseigneur, seeing that God has brought you so far, take
order, I beseech you, that so without any exception he may
approve you as a repairer of his temple, so that the times of
the king your nephew may be compared to those of Josiah, and
that you put things in such condition, that he may only need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to maintain the goodly order which God shall have prepared
for him by your means. I will mention to you an instance of
such corruptions, as, if they were allowed to remain, would become
a little leaven, to sour in the end the whole lump. In
your country, some prayer is made for the departed on occasion
of communicating in the Lord's Supper. I am well aware that
it is not done in admission of the purgatory of the Pope. I am
also aware that ancient custom can be pleaded for making some
mention of the departed, for the sake of uniting together all
the members of the one body. But there is a peremptory
ground of objection against it, that the Supper of Jesus Christ
is an action so sacred, that it ought not to be soiled by any
human inventions whatsoever. And besides, in prayer to God,
we must not take an unbounded license in our devotions, but
observe the rule which St. Paul gives us, (Romans x.,) which
is, that we must be founded upon the word of God; therefore,
such commemoration of the dead, as imports a commending
of them to his grace, is contrary to the due form and manner
of prayer,&mdash;it is a hurtful addition to the Supper of our Lord.
There are other things which possibly may be less open to
reproof, which however are not to be excused: such as the
ceremony of chrism and unction. The chrism has been invented
out of a frivolous humour by those who, not content
with the institution of Jesus Christ, desired to counterfeit the
Holy Spirit by a new sign, as if water were not sufficient for
the purpose. What they call extreme unction, has been retained
by the inconsiderate zeal of those, who have wished to
follow the apostles without being gifted as they were. When
the apostles used oil in the case of the sick, it was for the healing
of them miraculously. Now, when the gift of miracles has
ceased, the figure ought no longer to be employed. Wherefore,
it would be much better that these things should be pruned
away, so that you might have nothing which is not conform to
the word of God, and serviceable for the edification of the
Church. It is quite true we ought to bear with the weak; but
in order to strengthen them, and to lead them to greater perfection.
That does not mean, however, that we are to humour
blockheads who wish for this or that, without knowing why. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
know the consideration which keeps back many is, that they
are afraid too great a change could not be carried through. It
is admitted, that when we have to do with neighbours with
whom we desire to cherish friendly feeling, one is disposed to
gratify them by giving way in many things. In worldly matters,
that may be quite bearable, wherein it is allowable to yield
one to another, and to forego one's right for the sake of peace;
but it is not altogether the same thing in regard to the spiritual
governance of the Church, which ought to be according to the
ordinance of the word of God. Herein, we are not at liberty
to yield up anything to men, nor to turn aside on either hand
in their favour. Indeed there is nought that is more displeasing
to God, than when we would, in accordance with our own
human wisdom, modify or curtail, advance or retreat, otherwise
than he would have us. Wherefore, if we do not wish to
displease him, we must shut our eyes to the opinion of men.
As for the dangers which may arise, we ought to avoid them
so far as we can, but never by going aside from the straight
road. While we walk uprightly, we have his promise that he
will help us. Therefore, what remains for us is to do our duty,
humbly committing the event unto himself. And here we
may perceive wherefore the wise men of this world are ofttimes
disappointed in their expectation, because God is not with
them, when, in distrust of him and his aid, they seek out
crooked paths and such as he condemns. Do we then wish to
feel that we have the power of God upon our side? Let us
simply follow what he tells us. Above all, we must cling to
this maxim, that the reformation of his Church is the work of
his hand. Wherefore, in such matters, men must leave themselves
to be guided by him. What is more, whether in restoring
or in preserving the Church, he thinks fit, for the most
part, to proceed after a method marvellous, and beyond human
conception. And, therefore, it were unseemly to confine that
restoration, which must be divine, to the measure of our understanding,
and to bring that which is heavenly into subjection
to what is earthly and of this world's fashion. I do not
thus exclude the prudence which is so much needed, to take
all appropriate and right means, not falling into extremes either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
on the one side or upon the other, to gain over the whole
world to God, if that were possible. But the wisdom of the
Spirit, not that of the flesh, must overrule all; and having inquired
at the mouth of the Lord, we must ask him to guide
and lead us, rather than follow the bent of our own understanding.
When we take this method, it will be easy to cut
off much occasion of temptation, which might otherwise stop
our progress midway.</p>

<p>Wherefore, Monseigneur, as you have begun to bring back
Christianity to the place which belongs to it, throughout the
realm of England, not at all in self-confidence, but upheld by
the hand of God, as hitherto you have had sensible experience
of that powerful arm, you must not doubt that it shall continue
with you to the end. If God upholds the kingdoms and
the principalities of the infidels who are his enemies, far more
certainly will he have in safeguard those who range themselves
on his side and seek him for their superior.</p>

<p>I come now to the last point, which concerns the chastisement
of vice and the repression of scandals. I have no doubt
that there are laws and statutes of the kingdom both good and
laudable, to keep the people within the bounds of decency.
But the great and boundless licentiousness which I see everywhere
throughout the world, constrains me to beseech you, that
you would earnestly turn your attention to keeping men within
the restraint of sound and wholesome discipline. That, above
all, you would hold yourself charged, for the honour of God, to
punish those crimes of which men have been in the habit of
making no very great account. I speak of this, because sometimes
larcenies, assault, and extortions are more severely
punished, because thereby men are wronged; whereas they will
tolerate whoredom and adultery, drunkenness, and blaspheming
of the name of God, as if these were things quite allowable, or at
least of very small importance. Let us hear, however, what
God thinks of them. He proclaims aloud, how precious his
name is unto him. Meanwhile, it is as if torn in pieces and
trampled under foot. It can never be that he will allow such
shameful reproach to remain unpunished. More than this,
Scripture clearly points out to us, that by reason of blasphemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a whole country is defiled. As concerning adulteries, we who
call ourselves Christians, ought to take great shame to ourselves
that even the heathen have exercised greater rigour in their
punishment of such than we do, seeing even that some among
us only laugh at them. When holy matrimony, which ought
to be a lively image of the sacred union which we have with
the Son of God, is polluted, and the covenant, which ought to
stand more firm and indissoluble than any in this world, is
disloyally rent asunder, if we do not lay to heart that sin
against God, it is a token that our zeal for God is very low
indeed. As for whoredom, it ought to be quite enough for us
that St. Paul compares it to sacrilege, inasmuch as by its means
the temples of God, which our bodies are, are profaned. Be
it remembered also, that whoremongers and drunkards are
banished from the kingdom of God, on such terms that we are
forbidden to converse with them, whence it clearly follows, that
they ought not to be endured in the Church. We see herein
the cause why so many rods of judgment are at this very day
lifted up over the earth. For the more easily men pardon
themselves in such enormities, the more certainly will God
take vengeance on them. Wherefore, to prevent his wrath, I
entreat of you, Monseigneur, to hold a tight rein, and to take
order, that those who hear the doctrine of the Gospel, approve
their Christianity by a life of holiness. For as doctrine is the
soul of the Church for quickening, so discipline and the correction
of vices are like the nerves to sustain the body in a state
of health and vigour. The duty of bishops and curates is to
keep watch over that, to the end that the Supper of our Lord
may not be polluted by people of scandalous lives. But in the
authority where God has set you, the chief responsibility returns
upon you, who have a special charge given you to set the others
in motion, on purpose that every one discharge himself of
duty, and diligently to look to it, that the order which shall
have been established may be duly observed.</p>

<p>Now, Monseigneur, agreeably to the protestation which I
made above, I shall make no further excuse, neither of the
tiresomeness of my letter, nor on account of my having thus
freely laid open to you what I had so much at heart. For I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
feel assured that my affection is well known to you, while in
your wisdom, and as you are well versed in the Holy Scriptures,
you perceive from what fountain I have drawn all that is herein
contained. Wherefore, I do not fear to have been troublesome
or importunate to you, in making manifest, according as I
could, the hearty desire I have that the name of God may
always be more and more glorified by you, which is my daily
supplication; beseeching him that he would please to increase
his grace in you, to confirm you by his Spirit in a true unconquerable
constancy, upholding you against all enemies, having
yourself with your whole household under his holy protection,
enabling you successfully to administer the charge which is
committed to you, that so the King may have whereof to
praise this gracious God for having had such a governor in
his childhood, both for his person and for his kingdom.</p>

<p>Whereupon I shall make an end, Monseigneur, very humbly
commending me to your kind favour.</p>

</p>

<p>You ought not to impute to my negligence your not having
received a letter from me since you set sail from this place; for
I have found no one setting out in your direction. It is not
quite safe, moreover, in these times, for a letter to be carried
about by a variety of hands. In the next place, I hardly know
what to write to you, because there is nothing that is not fitted
to cause you much more annoyance than satisfaction. The
prefect Molard is here, with whom are joined as assessors the
eldest son of Balthazar and a certain Rigot of that faction. You
see, therefore, that there will be no danger this year to the wicked
from the severity of the judges. We wait, however, to see in
what channel their licence will break forth. On the same day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
our comic friend Cæsar again donned the socks.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Being now
rendered somewhat more ferocious, he boasts among his stage-players
after his own Thrasonic fashion. Finally, there appears
to be no hope of speedy amendment, whatever we may essay.
Nor is it to be doubted that they are labouring to effect a great
revolution in the republic at the next assembly of syndics; but
the Lord in heaven is vigilant.</p>

<p>The commotions at Bourdeaux are settled, or they are at least
lulled for a season.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> For examples of extreme cruelty have been
exhibited, which may in a short time boil forth in greater tempests.
The people of Saintonge keep themselves concealed in
the isles. Bucer lately wrote to me that Antiochus was looking
forward to a day of purification. As far as I can gather from his
letter, the council have no heart for that.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> I also received a

I shall send you a copy by the first messenger I can find. But
as Trolliet maintains among his own friends that there is no
need of so many books and sermons, I am afraid lest his authority
prove so powerful as to force us to seek a press elsewhere.
Adieu, brother and most sincere friend, along with your colleagues
Fatin, Michel, Thomas, and the rest of the co-presbyters.
May the Lord continue to guide you all by his Holy
Spirit. You will salute your whole family in my name and in
that of my wife. All my city colleagues salute you. The
others conduct themselves piously and uprightly, with the two
exceptions of Philip and Ludovic Siliniac. James Bernard had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>

allied the latter too closely with us. His brother left this for

<h3>Evidences of faith and Christian steadfastness, amid the dangers that threaten the
Church.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>December 1548</i>.]
</p>

<p>If the rumour that has suddenly been spread among us be
true, it behoves us to hold ourselves ready for the clash of arms.
Would that the world were wise, for in that case it would long
ago have been accustomed to cultivate peace under the favour
of God. But since a good part of it takes too much pleasure
in a war with God, it is but just that all those who refuse
peaceably to submit themselves to the Author of Peace, should
perish wretchedly in their mutual tumults. We ought at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to take this consolation in the midst of evils, that those stormy
troubles bring some cessation of hostilities to the Church of
God. The power of Antiochus will be ruined; our Pharaoh,
being conquered, will turn his violent assaults elsewhere, and
relax perchance somewhat of his severity at home. New
friends also will be able to effect some mitigation. I refrain
from exhorting you to use your efforts in the particular quarter
to which I refer, because I am persuaded that there is already
sufficient willingness. As to the rest, whether a final dispersion
be imminent, or, what is more pleasing to forecast, whether
the Lord has resolved to gather together, by means of earthly
commotions, into his heavenly kingdom, all those who are
now scattered and wandering wretchedly abroad, we shall have
cherished a friendship in good faith, the bond of which is inviolable....<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<h3>Exhortation to a courageous and honest profession of the truth.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 8th January 1549.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;I would not have taken the liberty to write to
you, if a man, whom I ought to trust among all others, had not
emboldened me to do so, by assuring me that my letter would
be agreeable to you. That is, Monsieur de Normandie, who,
feeling himself obliged to you for the kindness you had shewn
him, had a special desire to do you service, so far as he had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
means, and besides, has such a care of your salvation as he ought
to have who knows that you have loved him, as partaker of
a common Christian faith. On this account he has induced
me to write to you, thinking that not only you might take pleasure
in my letters, but that they might perhaps be profitable
for you, as well for your consolation in present extremity, as to
exhort you to perseverance so needful in the midst of such
manifold temptations. And would to God I might have more
ample opportunity of compliance with his request. But seeing
that it is his pleasure that we should be separated by so great
a distance, which does not permit more frequent communication
between us, I beseech you, Madame, to take what I do
write as a testimony of the earnest desire which I have to promote
your salvation. If, because of the confession you have
made of your Christianity, murmurs and threatenings rise up
against you, you must bear in mind to what we are called,
which is, that notwithstanding all sorts of contradiction on the
part of the world, we must render to the Son of God the
homage which belongs to him. These indeed should be to you
as so many warnings to prepare yourself for greater things,
for neither great nor small ought to seek exemption from
suffering in the cause of our Sovereign King, in which his
honour is as much involved as our salvation. Above all, since
himself has begun by shewing us the way, who among us shall
dare to refuse to follow him? Where is the greatness, or the
elevation, that can bestow greater privilege upon us than on
himself? And more than that, if we can appreciate the honour
he confers upon us in making use of our service to maintain
his so precious truth, we shall hold it to be a peculiar advantage,
rather than be annoyed on account of it. True it is, that
the human understanding cannot apprehend that; but, seeing
that the infallible wisdom of God pronounces, that those who
are persecuted for the testimony of the Gospel are most happy,
at all hazards we must needs acquiesce in that judgment. And
indeed, who are we that <em>we</em> should maintain the cause of God?
Where is our sufficiency for it, seeing that we are altogether
inclined to falsehood? How should we be witnesses for his
truth, unless by his own special gracious permission? On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
other hand, seeing that we deserve on account of our sins to
suffer all shame of face and ignominy, every sort of misery
and torment, yea were it even a hundred thousand deaths, if
that were possible, have we aught to complain of, ought we
not rather to rejoice, when, forgetting our faults, he wills that
we should suffer for his name? Therefore, inasmuch as we
are so froward and carnal that we cannot reach such elevation,
let us beg of this gracious God that he would please to imprint
in our hearts that which naturally we find so strange.
Furthermore, let us take to ourselves the example of the
Apostles, who counted the reproach of the world as a great
honour, and even gloried in it. In short, let us never think
that we have fully received the truth, if we do not prefer, above
all worldly triumphs, to fight under the banner of our Lord
Jesus, that is to say, to bear his cross.</p>

<p>Even so, Madame, consider, I beseech you, if hitherto you
have taken pains to serve and honour so good a master, how
you can strive more earnestly than ever to arm yourself against
opposition, to take courage against all difficulties in order to
surmount them; for, since the worldly often manifest invincible
constancy in the pursuit of their vanities, patiently enduring
so many labours, troubles, and dangers, it would be too
shameful were we to grow weary in the midst of the way of
salvation; albeit that this is by no means all that is required
of us, that we shew ourselves steadfast in the midst of persecutions;
for, even if there were no enemies to make open war
upon us, we find enough of aversion and indisposedness in
ourselves and all around, to hinder us in making our calling
sure, which all those who have a true zeal to devote themselves
to God, experience more fully than any one could tell them.
Inasmuch, then, as I hold you to be of the number, I entreat you
to exercise yourself continually in the doctrine of renouncing
the world yet more and more, in order to come nearer to our
Lord Jesus, who has once for all purchased us to separate us
unto himself. I mean the world, such as we carry it within
ourselves, before we are made again after his likeness. And
seeing that our whole nature, inasmuch as by the corruption
of the plague it has been depraved, is enmity against God, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot be duly established,
until all which is ours has been beaten down; and not only
the open vices which are condemned of men, but also even our
own reason and wisdom. I am aware that I do not speak to
you of any new thing, and that by the grace of God you have
long ago begun to follow in the way of the holy heavenly
calling. But the study of holiness is one of which we must
avail ourselves even to the end. And as I have ample cause
to praise God for the graces he has bestowed on you, and
whereby he magnifies himself in you, by making his own glory
to shine forth therein; in also looking to the frailty which we
all feel, I think it no superfluous trouble to exhort you to
follow on, as indeed you do. And even as it is becoming in
Christians to submit in all humility to receive the admonitions
which are addressed to them in the name of God, even that
the most learned should gladly submit to be taught, I hope
that you will receive the whole with a benign and kindly
heart. Believe me, when I hear that God has wrought so
powerfully in you, and that he has vouchsafed you such commendable
qualities, I am incited all the more to desire that he
would increase his work in you, until he has quite finished it;
and this it is that has constrained me more freely to declare
to you my desire and affection.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Madame, having humbly commended me to
your kind favour, I entreat our good Lord to have you in his
holy protection, to guide you by his Holy Spirit in all strength
and prudence, to vouchsafe you grace to promote his honour,
until he gather us all unto himself.</p>

<h2>CCXXXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Mademoiselle de....</span></h2>

<h3>Exhortations to steadfastness in the faith&mdash;acknowledgment of liberality.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>The 12th of January 1549.</i>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle my Sister</span>,&mdash;I am very glad that your letter
has afforded an occasion for my writing to you, so that without
further excuse access and freedom have been given me,
were it for nought else than to declare the affection I have for
you. Therein, that is in your letter, I can perceive evident
and clear signs of spiritual vitality; and I have not a doubt
but the heart speaks therein quite as much, or rather more
than the mouth. Besides, you shew convincingly that you
have no longer mere passing convictions, such as many people
have now-a-days, but that you have been touched to the quick,
and moved with the desire of dedicating yourself wholly to
God and to his will. It is very true, as you say, that while
clinging from worldly fear to the superstitions which in the
world reign paramount, you are still very far from that perfection
whereto our gracious God doth call us. But yet it is
to have made some progress even to acknowledge our sins,
and to be displeased with them. You must now advance farther,
and condemning your own weakness, set yourself in earnest
about getting rid of it; and if you cannot succeed all at
once in compassing your wish, yet nevertheless you must
persevere in seeking the remedy for it, until you have been
completely cured. To do this, you will find it to be of
advantage to call yourself to account day by day, and while
acknowledging your faults, to groan within yourself, and mourn
over them before God, so that your displeasure against whatsoever
is evil may become more intense, until you are quite
confirmed and resolved to renounce it as you ought, even as indeed
I feel assured you labour hard to do. And it is not in
vain that you beg of me to join my prayers with yours, to seek
with importunity to God that he would be pleased to have
compassion upon you, and to deliver you from this unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
captivity. Let us continue then with one accord to put up this
request, and he will at length make manifest that you have not
altogether lost your time. True, sometimes he lets us grow
faint, and before declaring effectually that he has heard our
prayers, he seems to keep at a distance, as much to sharpen
our desire, as to make trial of our patience; and, therefore, you
need not reckon that hitherto your prayers to him have been
in vain, but much rather take encouragement, and strive
even more and more, knowing that if perseverance be required
throughout our whole life, it is specially desired in prayer.
And, besides, you must also take care in real earnest to fan
the flame which God has already begun to kindle within you;
for all the gracious affections he breathes into us, are just so
many sparks which we must not extinguish, or allow to go out
by our heedlessness. Since, then, God has already opened your
eyes so far, that you admit we ought to be his peculiar
ones, and dedicated to him in righteousness, so as to glorify
him as well in our bodies as in our souls; seeing also that he
has touched your heart, so that you have some feeling of our
unhappiness in alienation from him, unquestionably you must
not now go to sleep or trifle away at your ease, but even as we
stir fire when it does not burn as it ought to do, it is quite
right that you be upstirred yet more and more, until the longing
desire to devote yourself wholly to him and to his righteousness,
overcomes all hindrances either from the flesh or
from the world. I see, or at least take into view, the very
great difficulties you have where you are; but since these considerations
do not excuse you in the sight of God, when the
question is of obedience to his word, and also in a thing of
so great importance as the rendering unto him the glory which
is due, and the making confession of your Christianity,&mdash;if I
desire your salvation as I ought, as God is my witness that I
do, it is my duty to awaken you, so far as I possibly can, not
that I can teach you any new thing, but that on my part I
may assist you in making a right use of that knowledge which
God has vouchsafed you; to wit, how reasonable it is that his
honour be preferred to our life, and also that we endeavour to
put away all those subterfuges, which our flesh suggests to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
for turning aside from the path which he points out. That
we may do so, we must learn a habit of forgetting ourselves,
for the allurements of the world are no less dangerous than
open war. The most humble have their share. You, on the
other hand, owing to the high condition wherein God has set
you, have a larger portion. But you must consider that this
is a discipline God sends you, in order that you may all the
better manifest the strength and vigour of the savour of our
heavenly life, when you shall have surmounted those great
obstacles, following out in spite of them your heavenly calling.
However, Mademoiselle, when you feel your own infirmity
so great, that in the midst of dangers you are unable
to give glory to God, do not neglect the remedy, which is to
betake yourself to the cross, where you may be joined to the
flock, and hear the voice of the Shepherd; whatever may
happen, shun to be as a sheep straying in the wilderness.
When you are in such a disposition, there is no doubt that
God will have compassion upon you, that himself will provide
when you shall see no means of doing so; for it is thus
that he withdraws his own not only from the mouths of wolves,
but from the very depths of hell.</p>

<p>I have received the ten crowns which you have sent for the
support of the poor believers who have need of it.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> I have intrusted
them to a discreet hand, to make distribution according
to your intention. May the Lord vouchsafe acceptance
of this alms at your hands, as a sacrifice of a sweet savour, and
cause you one day to rejoice in the spiritual benefits which he
has imparted to those you are thus helping in their earthly
poverty.</p>

<p>And now, Mademoiselle, having commended me humbly to
your kind favour, with prayer to our good Lord to uphold
you in his protection, to govern you always by his Spirit, and
to assist you in every way and evermore, I shall conclude for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the present. My wife also desires to be humbly commended
to your kind favour.</p>

<h3>Exhortations to discharge to the end their ministerial duties.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>16th January 1549</i>.]
</p>

<p>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;Very dear brethren, deserving of my
hearty reverence, what we so long feared has at length come to
pass, for Satan has, by the aid of his ministers, overturned
among you also the order of the Church as established by God.
Yet your letter was consolatory&mdash;so far as there could be any
consolation in so very sad a state of things&mdash;for we learned
from it that you were all faithful to the last in the discharge
of your duty. In denouncing, as you say you did, those seducers
who were making themselves busy in defiling the purity of
sound doctrine, you acted with a decision worthy of the ministers
of Christ. You now give a bright example of the sincerity
of your faith, in preferring even exile to perfidious dissimulation.
For when he who had hitherto given a hospitable reception
within his dominions to the Church of Christ, and had
granted you full permission to preach Christ, now deprives you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the office of teachers, there is no use in pushing the matter
farther, as we think, especially when there is no hope of making
progress, and when the sheep, over which Christ had made you
pastors, no longer desire your services. As he is a traitor who
voluntarily yields up and deserts his post, so it is our duty,
when forced, not to offer resistance, unless perhaps we should be
expressly called upon by the Church to undergo the extremity;
for it is a hundred times better to die, than for those who were
prepared to follow Christ to make vain their vows. But your case
is far different; for so long as you were pastors, you were faithful
and assiduous in your attention to your flocks. Now when
there is no use in desiring to persevere, and when the sheep
themselves, to whom your faith was pledged, do not consider it
profitable for you to proceed farther, you are certainly free from
all further obligation. It remains, therefore, for you to commend
to Christ the charges committed to you, that he alone by his
Spirit may give guidance when you have no longer any opportunity
of carrying on your labours. Henceforward we may
imagine what your sorrow must be, seeing that nothing presents
itself to you but exile and poverty. But your greatest affliction
will be caused by the misery of the Church, for whose interests
you have evinced greater regard than for your own. And we
indeed are equally affected&mdash;as we ought to be&mdash;by your public
and private misfortunes. Would that we could extend a helping
hand to you! For the rest, we exhort you to hold on to
the end in this your testimony of Christian sincerity. Your
lot, however hard, will be more blessed than if you maintained
a name and a place where the Son of God was exiled. Yet we
shall soon see him so reigning in heaven, as to make his power
appear also on the earth. Meanwhile, it becomes us to be
ready for the warfare, since it is not yet the hour of triumph.
Adieu, best and most upright brethren. May the Lord Jesus
Christ be with you, may he comfort and support you in your
devoted steadfastness.</p>

<p>Your brethren truly in the Lord, the Ministers of the
Church of Geneva.&mdash;In the name of all,</p>

<h3>Hope of union with the theologians of Zurich&mdash;dedication of several writings.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>21st January 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>I at length received your former letter, which I thought had
been destroyed, three days before the latter of the two reached
me. For when the person who married the other sister<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> sought
Hooper's<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> letter from his companion, observing another small
packet, he immediately laid hands on it. His companion,
either from modesty, or from some cause I know not what, did
not dare to take it from him. I have read your annotations,
from which I have discovered what you regard as wanting in
my method of treating the subject. I have endeavoured
briefly to satisfy you, because the matter itself did not demand
a long discourse. I shall know how far I have succeeded in
this, when I have received your reply. I may at least on good
grounds wish to obtain this of you, viz., that you will not
allow yourself to become entangled in baseless suspicions. For
I observe that, owing to this cause, you are perplexed in regard
to many points which present difficulty, simply because you
put upon the majority of my statements a different construction
from what you have any ground for doing. A pre-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>conceived
opinion regarding me leads you to imagine and attribute
to me what never occurred to my mind. Besides, while you are
concerned to maintain your own opinions, whatever they may be,
to the very last, you sometimes consider more what is in harmony
with them, than what is the truth on the subject. If
simplicity pleases you, I certainly take no delight in disguise
and circumlocution. If you love a free declaration of the
truth, I never had any mind to bend what I wrote, so as to receive
its acceptance with men. If there be any who have flattered
Luther and others, I am not of that number. Our most
excellent Musculus knows, that even when wise men were in
fear, I was always free [from apprehensions]. But had it not
been for the obstacle of an unprofitable distrust, there would
by this time have been no controversy between us, or none to
speak of. Although, however, I differ from you in opinion,
that does not imply the least severance of affection; just as I
cultivate the friendship of Bucer, and yet am free to dissent
occasionally from his views. You are accordingly too severe
in saying in your letter that the matter can only go well, provided
you understand that you are not regarded as our enemies.
On what grounds you form that surmise, I know not. This
indeed I know, that I both think and speak of you in a friendly
spirit. This, moreover, is known to very many who have heard
me speak. It may indeed be that I have found fault with you
in private letters to my friends, or that I have not concealed
my conviction, that what they censured was deserving of reprehension.
There was always, however, such an admixture of
praise, as qualified any bitterness, and afforded proof of good
intentions. Others may form what opinion they choose, but I
shall never have to repent of lack of integrity on my part. If
Master Blaurer<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> shall undertake Provence, which is offered to
him, and Musculus accept the Professorship of Theology, I
shall not only congratulate the Church of Berne, but hope that
this will prove a bond of closer relationship between us. I beg
you will inform me of your affairs, whenever an opportunity
occurs. You would have had my Commentaries on the Five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Epistles of Paul before this time, had I not thought that they
were for sale with you. As messengers rarely go and come
between this and your quarter, I was afraid that the carriage
would cost more than the purchase of them. I now send you
the Commentaries on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians,
and the four [Epistles] immediately following. I have yet
published nothing on the Epistle to Titus, and the two Epistles
to the Thessalonians. I also send my reply, which is highly
approved of by Brentius, whose opinion I do not mention
to you in the way of boasting, but that you may therefrom
form a conjecture as to how much more moderate he is in his
doctrine of the Sacraments than he formerly was. Adieu, most
illustrious sir, and dearest brother in the Lord. May the Lord
Jesus always guide you and your colleagues, all of whom you
will salute respectfully in my name. Ours in turn desire best
greetings to you, of whom Des Gallars presents for your acceptance
a small treatise he has composed. The best greeting to
Master Musculus, and other pious brethren.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Consolations to be found in the study of divine and everlasting truth.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>February 1549.</i>]
</p>

<p>As truth is most precious, so all men confess it to be so.
And yet, since God alone is the source of all good, you must
not doubt, that whatever truth you anywhere meet with, proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from him, unless you would be doubly ungrateful to
him; it is in this way you have received the word descended
from heaven. For it is sinful to treat God's gifts with contempt;
and to ascribe to man what is peculiarly God's is a
still greater impiety. Philosophy is, consequently, the noble
gift of God, and those learned men who have striven hard after
it in all ages have been incited thereto by God himself, that
they might enlighten the world in the knowledge of the truth.
But there is a wide difference between the writings of these
men and those truths which God, of his own pleasure, delivered
to guilty men for their sanctification. In the former, you may
fall in with a small particle of truth, of which you can get only
a taste, sufficient to make you feel how pleasant and sweet it
is; but in the latter, you may obtain in rich abundance that
which can refresh the soul to the full. In the one, a shadow
and an image is placed before the eyes which can only excite
in you a love of the object, without admitting you to familiar
intercourse with it; in the other, the solid substance stands
before you, with which you may not only become intimately
acquainted, but may also, in some measure, handle it. In
that, the seed is in a manner choked; in this, you may possess
the fruit in its very maturity. There, in short, only a few
small sparks break forth, which so point out the path that they
fail in the middle of the journey,&mdash;or rather, which fail in indicating
the path at all,&mdash;and can only restrain the traveller
from going farther astray; but here, the Spirit of God, like a
most brilliant torch, or rather like the sun itself, shines in full
splendour, not only to guide the course of your life, even to
its final goal, but also to conduct you to a blessed immortality.
Draw then from this source, wherever you may wander, and
as soon as he finds you a settled abode, you ought to make
that your place of rest....</p>

<h3>Desire of union between the Churches of Berne and Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>13th March 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>Seeing that we have, unsolicited, offered you a reading of our
views on the sacraments, it seems desirable to furnish you,
briefly, with some reason for our resolution in this matter;
although, indeed, no lengthened introduction is needed in
dealing with us in so just a cause. When your illustrious
senate has publicly called upon you to deliberate, among other
matters, regarding the peace of the Church, of which the peculiar
bond is harmony in purity of doctrine, it is probable
there will be some discussion regarding the sacraments, as that
subject has for a long time occupied the attention of the
Bernese Church. And while we are not required to make any
exposition of our doctrine, we have, nevertheless, thought it our
duty, even though unasked, to take part with you in bearing
testimony on a matter in which we have all been completely
unanimous. For since we both preach the same Christ, both
profess the same gospel, are both members of the same church,
and have both the same ministry, there ought not to be that
diversity of authority among us to which we have been subject,
either to break up the unity of our faith, or to hinder from
flourishing amongst us so many rights of holy fellowship consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to the service of Christ. That proximity of residence,
also, which is so influential among the children of this world,
in drawing them into close friendship, ought not, at least, to be
less powerful among us. We are, in reality, so commingled,
that even the situation of the two places brings us, as it were,
within a bond of mutual union. So far is this the case, that
there is a federal union between the two cities. Some of our
ministers, moreover, supply the churches of the Bernese district,
just as certain of your body, again, have some of the
churches of Geneva under their charge. It is, consequently,
to a great extent, as much your interest as it is ours to become
intimately acquainted with those doctrines to which we conform.
At all events, in this way&mdash;passing by other considerations&mdash;many
unfavourable suspicions will be counteracted,
and malicious men will be deprived of a source of abuse. We
confidently trust that our wishes will be agreeable, not only
to yourselves, but also to your most illustrious senate. It only
remains that you receive this communication calmly and with
forbearance. And if you do so, as there is the highest hope
you will, it will not be found to contain anything which you
may not easily comprehend. Adieu, dearly beloved and estimable
brethren and fellow-ministers; may the Lord Jesus long
preserve, by his strength, the Bernese republic in a most prosperous
condition. May he uphold the illustrious senate, under
whose auspices ye have been assembled. May he direct and
bless your assembly, and guide you by a spirit of wise zeal
and uprightness to promote the advancement and edification
of the Church.</p>

<h3>Death of Idelette de Bure, the wife of Calvin.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>April 7, 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>Although the death of my wife has been exceedingly painful
to me, yet I subdue my grief as well as I can. Friends, also,
are earnest in their duty to me. It might be wished, indeed,
that they could profit me and themselves more; yet one can
scarcely say how much I am supported by their attentions. But
you know well enough how tender, or rather soft, my mind is.
Had not a powerful self-control, therefore, been vouchsafed to
me, I could not have borne up so long. And truly mine is no
common source of grief. I have been bereaved of the best
companion of my life, of one who, had it been so ordered,
would not only have been the willing sharer of my indigence,
but even of my death. During her life she was the faithful
helper of my ministry. From her I never experienced the
slightest hindrance. She was never troublesome to me throughout
the entire course of her illness; she was more anxious about
her children than about herself.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> As I feared these private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
cares might annoy her to no purpose, I took occasion, on the
third day before her death, to mention that I would not fail in
discharging my duty to her children. Taking up the matter
immediately, she said, "I have already committed them to
God." When I said that that was not to prevent me from
caring for them, she replied, "I know you will not neglect
what you know has been committed to God." Lately, also,
when a certain woman insisted that she should talk with me
regarding these matters, I, for the first time, heard her give the
following brief answer: "Assuredly the principal thing is that
they live a pious and holy life. My husband is not to be urged
to instruct them in religious knowledge and in the fear of God.
If they be pious, I am sure he will gladly be a father to them;
but if not, they do not deserve that I should ask for aught in
their behalf." This nobleness of mind will weigh more with
me than a hundred recommendations. Many thanks for your
friendly consolation. Adieu, most excellent and honest brother.
May the Lord Jesus watch over and direct yourself and
your wife.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Present my best wishes to her and to the brethren.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Further details regarding the death of Idelette de Bure.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>11th April 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>Intelligence of my wife's death has perhaps reached you
before now. I do what I can to keep myself from being overwhelmed
with grief. My friends also leave nothing undone
that may administer relief to my mental suffering. When your
brother left, her life was all but despaired of. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
brethren were assembled on Tuesday, they thought it best that
we should join together in prayer. This was done. When
Abel, in the name of the rest, exhorted her to faith and patience,
she briefly (for she was now greatly worn) stated her frame of
mind. I afterwards added an exhortation, which seemed to me
appropriate to the occasion. And then, as she had made no
allusion to her children, I, fearing that, restrained by modesty,
she might be feeling an anxiety concerning them, which would
cause her greater suffering than the disease itself, declared in
the presence of the brethren, that I should henceforth care for
them as if they were my own. She replied, "I have already committed
them to the Lord." When I replied, that that was not
to hinder me from doing my duty, she immediately answered,
"If the Lord shall care for them, I know they will be commended
to you." Her magnanimity was so great, that she
seemed to have already left the world. About the sixth hour
of the day, on which she yielded up her soul to the Lord, our
brother Bourgouin<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> addressed some pious words to her, and
while he was doing so, she spoke aloud, so that all saw that her
heart was raised far above the world. For these were her
words: "O glorious resurrection! O God of Abraham, and of
all our fathers, in thee have the faithful trusted during so
many past ages, and none of them have trusted in vain. I also
will hope." These short sentences were rather ejaculated than
distinctly spoken. This did not come from the suggestion of
others, but from her own reflections, so that she made it obvious
in few words what were her own meditations. I had to go out
at six o'clock. Having been removed to another apartment
after seven, she immediately began to decline. When she felt
her voice suddenly failing her, she said: "Let us pray: let us
pray. All pray for me." I had now returned. She was unable
to speak, and her mind seemed to be troubled. I, having
spoken a few words about the love of Christ, the hope of
eternal life, concerning our married life, and her departure,
engaged in prayer. In full possession of her mind, she both
heard the prayer, and attended to it. Before eight she expired,
so calmly, that those present could scarcely distinguish between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
her life and her death. I at present control my sorrow so that
my duties may not be interfered with. But in the mean while
the Lord has sent other trials upon me. Adieu, brother, and
very excellent friend. May the Lord Jesus strengthen you by
his Spirit; and may he support me also under this heavy
affliction, which would certainly have overcome me, had not
he, who raises up the prostrate, strengthens the weak, and refreshes
the weary, stretched forth his hand from heaven to me.
Salute all the brethren and your whole family.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Account of the instructive death of Madame Laurent de Normandie.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 29th of April 1549.</i>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;Although the news which I communicate is
sad, and must also sadden the person to whom I beg you to
impart it, nevertheless I hope that my letter will not be unwelcome
to you. It has pleased my God to withdraw from
this world the wife of my kind brother, M. de Normandie.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Our consolation is, that he has gathered her unto himself;
for he has guided her even to the last sigh, as if visibly he
had held out the hand to her. Now, forasmuch as her father
must needs be informed,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> we have thought there was no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
more suitable than to request that you would please take the
trouble to request him to call on you, that the painful intelligence
may be broken to him by your communication of it.
What the gentleman has written to us who lately presented
our letter to you, has emboldened us to take this step, viz.,
that you had introduced the good man in question to the right
way of salvation, and that you had given him understanding of
the pure and sound doctrine which we must maintain. We do
not doubt, therefore, that you are willing to continue your good
offices, and that even in this present need. For we cannot
employ ourselves better, than in carrying this message in the
name of God, to comfort him to whom you have already done
so much good, that he may not be beyond measure disconsolate.
Therefore, Madame, I leave you to set before him the arguments
and reasons which you know to be suitable for exhorting
to submission. Only I shall shortly relate to you the history,
which will furnish you with ample matter for showing
him that he has reason to be thankful. And, according to the
grace and wisdom that God has given you, you will draw
thence for his comfort as opportunity shall require.</p>

<p>Having heard of the illness of the good woman, we were
amazed how she could have been able to bear so well the
fatigue of the journey, for she arrived quite fresh, and without
showing any sign of weariness. Indeed she acknowledged that
God had singularly supported her during that time. Weak as
she was, she kept well enough until a little before Christmas.
The eager desire which she had to hear the word of God,
upheld her until the month of January. She then began to
take to bed, not because the complaint was as yet thought
to be mortal, but to prevent the danger which might arise.
Although expecting a favourable termination, and hoping to
recover her health, she nevertheless prepared for death, saying
often, that if this was not the finishing blow, it could not be
long delayed. As for remedies, all was done that could be.
And if her bodily comfort was provided for, that which she
prized most highly was nowise wanting, to wit, pious admonitions
to confirm her in the fear of God, in the faith of Jesus
Christ, in patience, in the hope of salvation. On her part she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
always gave clear evidence that the labour was not in vain, for
in her discourse you could see that she had the whole deeply imprinted
upon her heart. In short, throughout the course of her
sickness, she proved herself to be a true sheep of our Lord Jesus,
letting herself be quietly led by the Great Shepherd. Two or
three days before death, as her heart was more raised to God,
she also spoke with more earnest affection than ever. Even
the day before, while she was exhorting her people, she said to
her attendant, that he must take good heed never to return
thither where he had polluted himself with idolatry; and that
since God had led him to a Christian Church, he should be
careful to live therein a holy life. The night following, she
was oppressed with great and continued pain. Yet never did
one hear any other cry from her, than the prayer to God that
he would have pity upon her, and that he would deliver her
out of the world, vouchsafing grace to persevere always in the
faith which he had bestowed. Toward five o'clock in the
morning I went to her. After she had listened very patiently
to the doctrine which I set before her, such as the occasion
called for, she said: "The hour draws near, I must needs depart
from the world; this flesh asks only to go away into corruption;
but I feel certain that my God is withdrawing my
soul into his kingdom. I know what a poor sinful woman I
am, but my confidence is in his goodness, and in the death
and passion of his Son. Therefore, I do not doubt of my
salvation, since he has assured me of it. I go to him as
to a Father." While she was thus discoursing, a considerable
number of persons came in. I threw in from time to time
some words, such as seemed suitable; and we also made
supplication to God as the exigency of her need required.
After once more declaring the sense she had of her sins,
to ask the pardon of them from God, and the certainty
which she entertained of her salvation, putting her sole confidence
in Jesus, and having her whole trust in him,&mdash;without
being invited by any one to do so, she began to pronounce
the Miserere as we sing it in church, and continued
with a loud and strong voice, not without great difficulty, but
she entreated that we would allow her to continue. Whereupon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
I made her a short recapitulation of the whole argument
of the psalm, seeing the pleasure she took in it. Afterwards,
taking me by the hand, she said to me, "How happy I am, and
how am I beholden to God, for having brought me here to die!
Had I been in that wretched prison, I could not have ventured
to open my mouth to make confession of my Christianity. Here
I have not only liberty to glorify God, but I have so many
sound arguments to confirm me in my salvation." Sometimes,
indeed, she said, "I am not able for more." When I answered
her, "God is able to help you; he has, indeed, shown you how
he is a present aid to his own;" she said immediately, "I do
believe so, and he makes me feel his help." Her husband was
there, striving to keep up in such sort that we were all sorry
for him, while he made us wonder in amazement at his fortitude.
For while possessed with such grief as I know it to have
been, and weighed down by extremity of sorrow, he had so far
gained the mastery over self, as to exhort his better part as
freely as if they were going to make a most joyful journey
together. The conversation I have related took place in the
midst of the great torment she endured from pains in her
stomach. Towards nine or ten o'clock they abated. Availing
herself of this relaxation, she never ceased to glorify God, humbly
seeking her salvation and all her wellbeing in Jesus Christ.
When speech failed her, her countenance told how intently she
was interested, as well in the prayers as in the exhortations
which were made. Otherwise she was so motionless, that sight
alone gave indication of life. Towards the end, considering
that she was gone, I said, "Now let us pray God that he
would give us grace to follow her." As I rose, she turned
her eyes upon us, as if charging us to persevere in prayer and
consolation; after that, we perceived no motion, and she passed
away so gracefully, that it was as if she had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>I pray you, Madame, to excuse me if I have been too tedious.
But I thought that the father would be well pleased to be
fully informed of the whole, as if he himself had been upon
the spot. And I hope that in so good a work you will find
nothing troublesome. St. Paul, in treating of charity, does not
forget that we ought to weep with those who weep; that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
say, that if we are Christians, we ought to have such compassion
and sorrow for our neighbours, that we should willingly
take part in their tears, and thus comfort them. It cannot
otherwise be but the good man must, at the first, be wrung
with grief. Howbeit he must already have been long prepared
to receive the news, considering that his daughter's sickness had
increased so much, that her recovery was despaired of. But
the great consolation is, the example which she has afforded to
him and to all of us, of bowing to the will of God. And thus,
seeing that she has presented herself so peaceably to death, let
us herein follow her, willingly complying with the disposal of
God; and if her father loved her, let him show his love in conforming
himself to the desire which she exhibited of submitting
herself to God. And seeing that her dismissal has been so
happy, let him rejoice in the grace of God vouchsafed to her,
which far surpasses all the comforts we can possess in this world.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Madame, having humbly commended me to
your kind favour, I beseech our good Lord to be always your
protector, to increase you with all spiritual blessing, and to
cause you to glorify his name even to the end.</p>

<p>
Your humble servitor and brother,</p>

<h3>Various particulars&mdash;recommendation of Francis Hotman, Jurisconsult.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>7th May 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>When Ferron was deposed he said you would write on his
behalf. I have not received anything as yet. He behaved so
insolently in our assembly that he very much resembled a man
deprived of his reason.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The Lord will direct the matter
according to his will; we have resolved on acting so moderately
as to show him that he has to do with men and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
servants of Christ. Cæsar the comedian annoys us in whatever
way he can. Hitherto it has so turned out that he has
gained nothing by it but the utmost disgrace. And yet, among
his own party he gives himself all the airs of a victor.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Haller
has at length explained what he would desiderate in our confession.
This consists of a great many unimportant and trivial
points. I shall reply to him as soon as I find opportunity. I
did not send you the letter before it was read to the brethren.
It is on this account that Hotman<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> has undertaken this journey
to you; he will carry it more safely than otherwise. I do not
think it proper, nor have I been disposed, to inquire more
minutely into that situation to which he aspires, except that
he has resolved to dedicate his work to the Lord and to the
Church. I especially approve of this resolution. For he has
strong native talent, is of extensive erudition, and is possessed
of other valuable qualities. However, I know that you think
so highly of him that there is no need of me recommending
him. And, as you are of opinion that his work would be useful,
I have no doubt that you would be sufficiently disposed of
yourself to aid him. I was unwilling, however, to act so, that
he might think me wanting in my duty to him. I shall only
add, that he should understand there is nothing nearer our
hearts than that he should devote his labour to the Church.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and most sincere friend. May the Lord
Jesus preserve yourself, your wife, and your little daughter,
and send a blessing upon your sacred labours. Salute all respectfully
in my name.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Pleading in favour of the alliance of the Reformed Cantons with France.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>7th May 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>As time does not permit me to reply to your letter now, I
am merely desirous of telling you that I have scarcely ever received
anything more pleasant from you, as it served to alleviate
a very trying domestic grief, which, occasioned by the death of
my wife a little before, was causing me very much sorrow. For
I am very glad that hardly anything&mdash;or at least very little&mdash;hinders
us from agreeing now even in words. And, certainly
if you think you can so arrange matters, I make no objection
against endeavours being made to come hither, that you may
the better become acquainted with all the sentiments of my
mind. Nor shall it ever be owing to me that we do not unite
in a solid peace, as we all unanimously profess the same
Christ. But I have, at present, another reason for writing
you.</p>

<p>You partly indicate what has kept you back from joining in
the French alliance. I confess the godly have just cause of
alarm in the example of Jehoshaphat, who bound himself in an
unfortunate alliance with a wicked king, to his own ruin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that of his kingdom. Yet I do not so understand it, that he
was punished because he made a league with the King of
Israel, but rather because he espoused a bad and impious cause,
in order to gratify that king's desire. Ambition was inciting him
to an unprovoked attack upon the Syrians; Jehoshaphat complied
with his wishes and rashly took up arms. Add to this,
that they went forth to battle, the Lord through Micaiah forbidding
them. This example does not, therefore, so weigh with me
that I should pronounce all alliance whatever with the wicked
to be unlawful. For I reflect that Abraham was not hindered
by any religious scruples from making a covenant with Abimelech.
Isaac, David, and others did the same, and received
neither reproof nor punishment. I can, however, so far conclude,
that alliances of this nature are not to be sought after,
seeing they must always be attended with very much danger.
But if we be at all incited&mdash;I should rather say urged&mdash;to it by
a just motive, I see no reason why we should be altogether
averse to it.</p>

<p>Moreover, as regards the alliance in question, I cannot hold
that it should be so avoided, from this cause, unless the present
aspect of the times should compel me to adopt an opposite conclusion.
You have to do with a professed enemy of Christ,
and one who is daily venting his rage against our brethren.
He is too little deserving of trust that could wish that both we
and Christ were annihilated. It is absurd that we should enter
into friendly alliance with one who is at war with all the servants
of Christ without distinction; that we should seize, as
that of an ally, a hand polluted with innocent blood. And,
certainly, I should be unwilling to come to any conclusion on
the matter, unless it were the express and distinct wish of the
pious brethren. For his ferocity is indeed extraordinary.
Besides, I am suspicious of the war with England. For I do
not think it right to furnish any aid against a kingdom in
which Christ is worshipped; and the very injustice of the
cause, also, is another obstacle.</p>

<p>But, again, when I consider how our cause has been
weakened, how great are the calamities which still impend,
threatening almost the ruin of the Church, I fear much that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
we neglect those aids which it is not unlawful to employ, we
may fall into a state rather of excessive carelessness than of
devout trustfulness. Nor, in truth, am I ignorant that God is
especially present with us, and powerfully succours us when
we are destitute of all human aid. I know, also, that there is
nothing harder, when he reveals himself through some Egyptian
shade, than to keep the eye from turning aside; for if they be
not fixed on the one God, they rove wickedly and perniciously.
We must, therefore, endeavour zealously to counteract these
dangers. Meanwhile, however, we should be on our guard,
lest if, in this our critical condition, we reject what, without
offending God, could have aided us, we may afterwards feel, to
our loss, that we were too careless. My first fear is, that our
Pharaoh, shut out from all hope of contracting friendship with
you, may betake himself to Antiochus. How much soever they
may have weighty grounds of disagreement, this latter is a
wonderful master at contriving pretexts; and those who at
present hold sway at our court, would desire nothing more than
to incline the mind of a youth, both inexperienced and not
sufficiently sagacious, to accept of peace on any terms whatever.
Certainly, if he has not already concluded it he will do so in a
short time. Nor will there be wanting those who will urge
him on. And I would there were none among us who would
hold themselves and us as slaves to Antiochus, should an opportunity
occur for doing so. He will, in truth, attempt every
thing, the other not only approving of it, but also, in the mean
time, assisting in it; because he will suppose that in this way
he is avenging his repulse. In the mean while, cruelty will be
kindled everywhere through the kingdom itself, for he will, as
women are wont, direct his own rage to another,&mdash;a consideration,
certainly, not to be accounted last by us of this place. If
I wished to regard my own life or private concerns, I should
immediately betake myself elsewhere. But when I consider
how very important this corner is for the propagation of the
kingdom of Christ, I have good reason to be anxious that it
should be carefully watched over; and, in this respect, it is for
your advantage, and quiet partly depends upon it. What man,
imbued with wicked schemes, when he has been estranged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
you, will not be moved by despair? But you think that we
are wanting in men of discontented and revolutionary character,
or in those suffering from want, who have, for a long period,
extended their hands to him. However, as often as I reflect
particularly upon our wretched brethren who lie crushed under
that fearful tyranny, my mind becomes soft and more disposed
to this [alliance], as it the more unquestionably appears beneficial
for the alleviation of their sufferings. Why is the rage of
the tyrant to be removed when he has seen that he is despised
and scorned? Is it that thereby the wicked are to have the
greater license for tormenting the innocent? Thus, if any
alliance does intervene, not only will Pharaoh himself be, for
the present, somewhat softened, and the executioners rendered
less daring, but it will, indeed, be possible also to extinguish
the flames.</p>

<p>I beseech and solemnly implore you then, my dear Bullinger,
to ponder in time all these considerations; and if you come to
any agreement, strive earnestly to have your brethren remembered
whose condition is so wretched and awful. For although
I know you have their welfare sufficiently at heart, and am
certain that when the matter is raised, you will, of your own
accord, be solicitous about it, yet I did not wish to neglect my
duty. Indeed, such is his fierceness, that no fixed law can be
laid down for you. I hope it is possible to show, however,
that some sort of moderation may be exhibited.</p>

<p>Adieu, excellent man, and much esteemed brother in the
Lord. Salute especially Theodore, Pellican, Gualter, Vuerduler,
and the rest of the fellow-ministers. Present my respects to
your colleagues, and to Des Gallars among the rest. I pray
the Lord Jesus that he may continue to guide and sustain you
by his Spirit; may he bless you and your labours. I have to
thank you greatly for the volume of discourses which Haller
sent in your name.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>He exhorts her and her companions to live in conformity with the law of God.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 10th of June 1549.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame and well-beloved Sister</span>,&mdash;As we ought to be
glad when the kingdom of the Son of God our Saviour is multiplied,
and the good seed of his doctrine is everywhere spread
abroad, I have been greatly rejoiced in perceiving from your
letter that his grace and bounty has reached to you, to draw
you on in the knowledge of his truth, wherein lies our salvation
and every blessing. Indeed, it is a kind of miracle when
he is pleased to make his glorious light shine in the place of
such deep darkness; and this I say, that you and your associates
may be the more induced to value the inestimable benefit
which he has conferred on you. For if the lies of Satan
wherewith he has blinded and bewitched the wretched world
reign everywhere at present, they have their chief seat in those
unhappy prisons which he has reared up, that he may keep
souls in a twofold captivity. Acknowledge then that our good
Lord has reached out a hand to you, even to the depths of the
abyss, and that in so doing he has expressed an infinite compassion
toward you. Wherefore it is your duty, as St. Peter
has told us, to employ yourself in magnifying his holy name.
For in calling us to himself, he sets us apart in order that
our whole life may be to his honour, which it cannot be without
our withdrawing ourselves from the pollutions of this world.
And indeed there ought to be a difference between those who
are enlightened by Christ Jesus, and the poor blinded ones who
know not whither they are going. Therefore take heed that
the knowledge which he has bestowed upon you be not unimproved,
that you may not be reproached at the great day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
having made void his grace. But because I am confident that
you do so as much as lieth in you, I shall not dwell at greater
length on that subject. It is quite certain that we cannot be
too earnestly importuned on this very point. Besides, I believe
that you will receive this exhortation as you ought, not thinking
it superfluous, inasmuch as it may be of service to you
against many assaults which Satan never ceases to make upon
all the children of God. Now, while he has many ways in this
world for seducing us out of the straight path, we on our parts
are so pitiably frail, that we are immediately overcome.
Wherefore we have much need to arm ourselves completely at
every point. Moreover, being sensible of our infirmity, which
makes us so often come short, we should supplement the exhortations
which are made to us in the name of God, with
prayer and supplication, that it would please our heavenly
Father to strengthen us by his might, and to supply whatsoever
is lacking. However it may be, let us never seek out
excuses to flatter ourselves in our vices as the most part do, but
let us be thoroughly convinced that God's honour deserves to be
preferred to everything else, yea verily to life itself. And let
us not think it strange, if for his name's sake we be chased
from one place to another, and that we must forsake the place
of our birth, to transport ourselves to some unknown place, for
we must even be ready to depart from this world whensoever
he shall call us away. I understand quite well, that in such
bondage as you now are, you can not serve God purely without the
rage and cruelty of the wicked rising up immediately against
you, and without the fire perhaps being lighted. Such being
the case, were it even necessary that you should compass sea
and land, never grow weary in seeking the liberty to regulate
yourself entirely according to the will of your kind heavenly
Father. Howbeit, you must remember, that wherever we may
go, the cross of Jesus Christ will follow us, even in the place
where you may enjoy your ease and comforts. Lay your account
with it, that even in the country where you have liberty,
as well to honour God as to be confirmed by his word, that you
will have to endure many annoyances. For this is the very way
whereby God would make trial of our faith, and know whether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in seeking after him, we have been renouncing self. It is right
that you be informed of this beforehand, so that it may not be
new to you when the experience of it comes, though I doubt
not that you and your associates are already prepared for it.
But the chief thing is to pray God that he would lead you, as
well to guide you as to uphold by his strong arm, in order that
as he has begun a good work in you, he would continue it until
he has brought you on to that perfection, after which we must
aspire until we are gone forth out of this world. And to confirm
you in this respect, recall to mind continually what an
unhappiness it is to be in perpetual disquietude and trouble of
conscience. In this condition of mind, you will naturally abhor
the wretched state in which you are, and count but dung all
those delights and all those comforts which you must purchase
at so sad a price as that of daily offending God. When you
consider that our life is accursed, and, of course, worse than any
kind of death, if our state be not approved of God, no bands of
any earthly comforts will be so strong that you will not easily
rend them asunder, so as entirely to escape from a kind of life
which God condemns, especially to live in a place where not
only you may be free to follow a holy and Christian calling,
but where you will likewise have the means of exercising yourself
daily in sound doctrine, of which we are so clearly enjoined
to avail ourselves. Such a recompense of reward may well
stifle all regret of the flesh-pots and pleasures of Egypt, and
encourage us rather to follow God in the wilderness than to
befool ourselves in the practice of those lusts which our flesh
desires and longs for.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Madame and good sister, having affectionately
commended me to your kind favour, and that of your companions,
I pray our good Lord more and more to increase his
spiritual blessings upon you, to keep you wholly in his obedience,
and to have you under his protection and defence
against all the ambushes of Satan and those who belong to
him.</p>

<p>
Your humble servant and brother,</p>

between the Churches of Geneva and Zurich.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>June 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>Although your letter was mixed with joy and sorrow, yet it
was extremely pleasant to me. Would that I were able in some
measure to lighten the sufferings of your heart, and those cares
by which I see you are tortured! We all beseech you, again
and again, not to keep afflicting yourself to no purpose. Yet it
is neither proper in itself, nor is it in keeping with your piety,
nor should we desire to see it, that amid such various and
manifold causes for grief, you should be joyous and cheerful.
You should make it your study, however, to serve the Lord and
the Church as far as you have opportunity. You have indeed
run a long race, but you know not how much may be still
before you. It may be that I, who have just commenced the
race, am at present nearer to the goal. But the direction and
the termination of your course are alike in the hand of the
Lord. I am a daily witness to many deaths, in order that I may
be made as active as possible amid the dangers which threaten
us from many quarters. Just as wars keep you busy where
you are, so we here give way to sluggish fears. I trust, however,
that the internal tumults are already calmed; and there
is a report of a cessation of hostilities between you and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
French.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Would that a plan of stable peace could be agreed
upon: for we see that trainer of gladiators, who is bringing
these two kingdoms into conflict, in the meantime laughing
at his ease, and ready to seize any turn of fortune, in order
that he may attack the victor with fresh forces, and gather the
spoils of the vanquished without sweat and blood, and thus
triumph over and carry off the booty from both.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> But when
I reflect on the wicked counsels by which France is ruled, I
almost despair of this matter. Indeed, they fear him more
than enough; but, by haughtily despising others, they do not
guard themselves against his craft. And indeed the Lord is
by this blindness justly avenging, as I take it, their atrocious
cruelty to his saints, which is daily increasing. Just as their
wickedness is gathering strength, and is continually becoming
worse, so I pray that the English may, with a contrary emulation,
make a stand for the genuine purity of Christianity, until
everything in that country is seen to be regulated according to
the rule which Christ himself has laid down. As you wished,
and as the present state of things urgently demanded, I have
attempted to encourage the Lord Protector; and it will be
your duty to insist by all means, if you get a hearing&mdash;and of
that I am persuaded&mdash;that those rites which savour of superstition
be entirely removed. I particularly commend this to
you, that you thereby may free yourself of a charge which
many, as you know, falsely bring against you; for they always
regard you as either the author or approver of half measures.
I know that this suspicion is fixed too deeply in the minds of
some to be easily rooted out, even if you do your best. And
some have been led to calumniate you spitefully for no error
whatever. This is accordingly damaging to you, in some
measure fatal, as you can with difficulty escape from it. However,
you must be on your guard, lest occasion of suspicion be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
afforded the ignorant: the wicked eagerly snatch at any pretext
for abuse. I am exceedingly sorry that N.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> is annoying
you without cause. Would that he would learn humanity
some time! I am the more ready to pardon him, as he seems
to me to be so moved by malice, as to be driven by a blind impulse.
You cannot credit how bitterly he has wounded us at
times; alike the innocent, the absent, and the friendly. When
Viret was well nigh overcome by the very great injustice of
some, and by the perfidiousness of others, he was as violently
attacked by this individual, as if he had been the most infamous
traitor to the Church. He would certainly accustom
himself to mildness if he knew what hurt is done by the intemperateness
of his too fervid zeal and immoderate severity.
You must endure with your accustomed forbearance this and
other indignities offered to you. The people of Zurich, certainly,
did not approve of his cause. I differ from you somewhat
in this matter; in that, you think injury will be done to
the opposite party. For while you think that they would
never labour under such gross hallucinations as to imagine that
Christ was diffused everywhere, you do not hold what Brentius,
among others, has written, that when Christ was lying in the
manger he was, even as to his body, full of glory in heaven.
And to speak more plainly, you know that the Popish doctrine
is more moderate and sober than that of Amsdorf,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and those
resembling him, who have raved as if they were the priestesses
of Apollo. You know how cruelly Master Philip has been annoyed,
because he observed a certain degree of moderation. In
their madness they even drew idolatry after them. For what
else is the adorable sacrament of Luther but an idol set up in
the temple of God? I desired, however, to see all these things
buried. Indeed I have done my utmost among our neighbours
to keep them from railing; yet as it afforded them satisfaction,
I did not hesitate, the names being suppressed, to condemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
all the errors to which I was expressly opposed. You certainly
seem to me to enter with too much subtlety into the discussion
about place. Others are more seriously offended by your obscurity,
which they think you have studied craftily to employ.
I know indeed that in this they are wrong. But I do not see
why you should shrink so much from what we teach; that when
Christ is said to have ascended into heaven, there is affirmed
by this expression a diversity of places. For it is not disputed
here whether there is place in celestial glory, but only whether
the body of Christ is in the world. As the Scriptures have
borne clear testimony on that point, I have no hesitation in embracing
it as an article of faith. And yet, as you will find
from our document,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> this was yielded to the fretfulness of some,
not without a struggle: for I had framed the words differently.
Nothing was comprised in this formula which we employed,
except what I perceived it would be scrupulousness not to concede
to others. You wish piously and wisely, to explain more
clearly and fully the effect of the Sacrament, and what the
Lord bestows through it. Nor indeed was it owing to me that
they were not fuller on some points. Let us bear therefore
with a sigh what we cannot correct. You will find here a copy
of the document which they sent me. The two paragraphs
which you feared they would not admit, were readily adopted.
Had the rest imitated the calmness of Bullinger, I should have
obtained all more easily. It is well, however, that we have
agreed about the truth, and that we are at one in the most important
sense. It would be exceedingly appropriate for you to
modify these two theses somewhat, in order to bring out more
clearly that you place Christ apart from us who are in the
world, by a diversity of place; in the second place, that you
might discard the more obviously all those false inventions by
which the minds of men have been led to superstition; and
above all, that you might vindicate the glory of the Holy Spirit
and of Christ, lest aught should be attributed to the ministers
or to the elements. At the commencement of our deliberations,
agreement seemed really hopeless. Light suddenly broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
forth. Our forefathers wished to deliberate with other Churches.
We agreed without difficulty. N.'s dissension must be borne
with equanimity. Farel, as you will see, writes you at great
length. Viret dare not, for you cannot believe how unjustly he
is treated. He salutes you as dutifully as he can, and wishes
you to excuse him. All my colleagues, also, salute you respectfully.
There is nothing new here except that Zurich and
Berne have cut off all hopes of an alliance with France.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>

perseverance in the true faith.</h3>

<i>17th June 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>As your mother, illustrious lady, lately presented me with a
ring, as a token of her good-will towards me, which I did not
at all deserve, it would be exceedingly unbecoming in me not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to show some sign of gratitude, by giving expression, at least,
to my regard for her. But not being able to find language,
again, in which to discharge this sort of duty, nothing seems
fitter than that I should call you to my aid, noble lady, distinguished
no less by your worth than by your descent. For
as you will be, of all others, the most suitable negotiator with
your mother, you will be glad to present this mark of respect
to her, in virtue of your very great affection for her; and, particularly,
as the address will not, or I am mistaken, be unpleasant
to her. For I learn you have understood from her words
that she is agreeably disposed towards me. Now, if my prayers
be of any avail with you, I would particularly request of you,
not to take amiss the humble salutation offered, with all submission,
by me to her, that she may, at least, understand, that
that gift of which I was held worthy was not bestowed upon
one who knew not to be grateful. Moreover, I made bold to
use the more confidence with you, as I learned that you were
not only cultivated in liberal knowledge, (a singular thing in a
young person of rank of this place,) but that you were also so
well informed in the doctrines of Christ, that you grant a willing
access to his ministers, among whose number, if I mistake
not, you acknowledge me a place. It remains for me to exhort
you to pursue your so happy course, even although, as I hear,
you are willing enough of yourself; and I trust that the Lord
who gave you this disposition, will also grant you steadfastness
to persevere to the end. However, you will take my exhortation
in good part, as incitements are never superfluous, since
there are so many obstacles and hindrances in the world, and
so many infirmities in our flesh. Certainly, among so many
excellent gifts with which God has endowed and adorned you,
this stands unquestionably first,&mdash;that he stretched out his
hand to you in tender childhood, to lead you to his own Son,
who is the author of eternal salvation, and the fountain of all
good. It becomes you to strive, with all the more zeal, to
follow eagerly at his call. Especially as he has, at the same time,
given you that support of which we see not only the daughters
of noblemen, but even noblemen themselves, to be often deprived.
Salute your brother&mdash;a boy of heroic nature&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
your very noble sisters. May the Lord enrich you daily with
his blessing, and may he be the constant guide of the whole
course of your life.</p>

yours to obey you,</p>

pieces. The members of his family led me to expect a tolerably
liberal present from him, in a short time, which I neither

<h3>Imprisonment of two brothers of M. de Falais&mdash;persecution in the Low Countries

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>19th July 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>You know of the letter we have received from Bullinger. I
was hoping the Bernese were going to give over negotiations.
At all events, the inhabitants of Zurich see now with what just
reason we in time past complained of our broken heads. Haller
lately confessed to me that he would gladly have written, had
Schirma not been afraid. I certainly excuse what does not provoke
such rage. The people of Zurich might have obtained
their wishes from the Senate, had they not stripped themselves
of all liberty. For they have so often repeated this old song&mdash;that
they should abide by things as they were, that nothing
further should be done, that something deceptive always
lurked under the guise of harmony&mdash;that they are now ashamed
to say a word on the opposite side. Nothing remains for them
now but to suppress everything, or follow that new plan of
yours. I was astonished that Viret did not indicate by a single
word what was your opinion of them both. Be sure to let me
know at your very first opportunity what arrangement you
think should be made. I have nothing further to add except
that two of M. de Falais' brothers are in prison.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> After the
Emperor had given them a polite reception, he sent them to
Granvelle. He received them courteously also. On leaving
him, they were bound by the officer, and thrust hastily into
prison. They were then removed to the Castle of Villevord,
whence no one is brought forth except for punishment. Awful
persecution blazes now over that region; let us then assist the
godly brethren with our prayers.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The Frenchman is as mad

<p>You ought also to add your judgment to the letter of Bullinger.
The reason which he prefixes for publishing the agreement,
has something or other absurd in it. I fear again that
the same over-scrupulousness will appear in this affair. I shall
neglect nothing, however, which you and Farel think it useful

<p>I have written to Paris concerning the Hebrew professor.

<h3>Urgent recommendation of the adoption of a fixed formulary in the celebration of the
Lord's Supper.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>1st August 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>Although I have repeated occasion to act with you concerning
the same matter, yet I do not think I should be afraid of
seeming troublesome. Since the same subject is a matter of
common interest to us, it cannot be that you will disapprove of
what I am engaged in, and, as the perpetual importunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
good men urges me to it, a little more zealously than is proper.
I have oftentimes already given advice regarding a small
matter, although many were offended, not without a show of
reason, at my seeming to teach something or other different
from you regarding the sacraments. Your Church, adorned
with so many distinguished gifts, is deservedly held in honour
by those men. They show some [respect] to our Church also,
and, perhaps, to myself as an individual. So they are anxious
to obtain assistance from our writings in coming to a knowledge
of the doctrines of sacred duty, lest any sort of discussion
should retard their progress. I have thought, accordingly,
that no remedy was better fitted for removing this offence
than if, to show our unanimity, we were to enter kindly
into consideration of it by means of friendly conference. For
this purpose I have, as you are aware, undertaken a journey
to you. And our venerable associate, William Farel&mdash;that
indefatigable soldier of Christ, and my guide and counsellor&mdash;has
not been reluctant to join me as a companion, in order to
unite with us in bearing truly and faithfully what testimony
we can on the one side and on the other. But because, in the
present state of the question, I do not carry all along with me,
I am greatly pained that those, whose peace of mind I should
wish to regard, continue in a troubled, or, at all events, in an
uncertain state. And, just as I said at the outset, I think I do
nothing unseasonable, when I insist on there being some public
testimony made regarding those points on which we are
agreed. I have indeed thought it a reward for my trouble to
draw up briefly and arrange those paragraphs on which we
have conferred, in order that, if my plan be approved of by
you, any one may see at a glance, as it were, what we have
been engaged in, and what we have completed. I certainly
do trust that you will be my witnesses, that I have reported
faithfully all that I have brought forward. Pious readers
will doubtless observe, that we&mdash;I mean Farel and myself&mdash;have
with equal care sought perspicuity, unmixed with any
deceit, and void of all guile. Nevertheless, I should wish
them, at the same time, to be reminded, that there is nothing
contained here which our fellow-labourers also, be they who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they may, whether serving Christ under the rule of the Genevese
Republic, or in the Neuchatel district, have not by their
signature approved.</p>

<p>Adieu, most excellent men and brethren, deserving of my
hearty regard. May the Lord continue to guide you by his
Spirit in the edification of his Church, and may he bless our
labours.</p>

<h3>Revisal of the Formulary&mdash;persecutions in France.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>13th August 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>I was reminded, when it was too late, of the departure of the
registrar. For it was not convenient for me to write then&mdash;on
account of the Supper namely&mdash;especially as I was not able
to do it so satisfactorily as could be wished. Indeed this is
almost a customary thing with me. But a letter came into my
possession to-day which you had written just before mine was
composed. I had delayed writing you a private letter, indeed,
until a trustworthy messenger might be at hand to convey it to
you. And although I had not actually come under any obligation,
I was unwilling to forego the opportunity which presented
itself. You will ascertain whether the edition with this
new preface will satisfy the Bernese. Of yourself and your
associates I have no doubt. For, in my opinion, I have followed
your outlines and only spread my colours over them.
But you remember what I lately wrote regarding your two
paragraphs. I am persuaded there will be no one among you
who would not, of his own accord, desire my additions. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
they are of especial importance, lest some might think we were
rather artfully silent, and others justly desire what must necessarily
be expressly stated. The third correction will present
no difficulty save in one or two words. I know the whole
matter must so commend itself to you and to the rest of the
brethren, that I shall entirely acquiesce in your decision.
What you decide upon, therefore, I shall regard as altogether
satisfactory. I think, again, that you will understand what I
am aiming at.</p>

<p>I dare hardly venture to give you anything new from this
place, there are so many idle rumours daily afloat. This, at
least, is certain, that numerous dangers are not very far distant,
unless the Lord counteract them. All that I wish is, that
Christians may live securely, as they can die securely. The
Frenchman is so insane, that, as one may say, he wishes, after
the fashion of the giants, to fight against God.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In the meanwhile,
the firmness of the martyrs is wonderful.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> It was a new
thing for the king, when one of them of his own accord devoted
himself as a sacrifice, that he might openly address to
him at least three words for Christ, when he was preparing to
witness the burning. I do not write to Celio, and perhaps
he has not yet gone to you. If he is there, I should wish him,
as previously ordered, to speak to the bookseller regarding the
money for which I became security. He complains that the
decision will be unfair. Our friend, however, says the opposite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
I remain neutral. But since I have pledged my word, I am

<h2>CCLI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Farel and Viret.</span></h2>

<h3>Letter concerning Vergerio&mdash;history of Francis Spira.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>15th August 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>You have here the letter which I sent to Bullinger.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> I resolved,
indeed, not to send it until I should learn that it would
be agreeable to you. But the messenger, who has just left me,
having unexpectedly presented himself, led me to change this
resolution. It might perhaps have been written better by
another, yet I hope it will appear tolerably satisfactory to you.
Having the utmost confidence in your carefulness, my dear
Viret, I have not retained a copy of it. You will see then,
that a copy of it be put into the hands of Farel, that I may get
back this my autograph. I know that what I have written is
nothing but some few trifles or other which I have collected,
and which are alike unworthy of me to write and of you to
read, especially as they are circulated by public report. A few
days ago I received a letter from Paolo Vergerio, with a history
of Francis Spira, which he desired to be published here.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
states that he was compelled to go into exile, chiefly because
the Pope, enraged by this publication, was laying insidious
stratagems for his life. He is living at present among the
Rhætians. He says, however, that he is strongly inclined to
visit us.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The history I have not yet examined thoroughly.
So far, however, as I may judge of such a communication, it
seems to be written with a little more prudence and sobriety
than were those epistles [of his] which Celio translated. When
I shall have examined it more carefully, I must consider what
preface I should write to it. Adieu, most worthy brethren and
friends. May God preserve you and your families, and continue
to guide you by his Spirit even to the end!&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Criticism on a work by Farel.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>1st September 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>You will learn from your brother that the painful case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Ferron has been renewed.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Bullinger, as you will observe,
writing previous to receiving my letter, had good hopes of publishing
a union. I make honourable mention of you in my
preface; even if it should give pain to the wicked, they must
nevertheless swallow it in silence. I have written nothing regarding
your book,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> as I laid the whole burden on Viret. I
said from the first, what is true, that I mistrusted my own
judgment regarding your writings, seeing that our mode of
writing is so different. You know with what respect I regard
Augustine. Not, however, because I disguise from myself how
much his prolixity dissatisfies me. Perhaps my style, in the
mean time, is over-concise. But I am not at present discussing
which is best. For I have not confidence in myself [to do so],
for this reason, that whilst I follow my own inclination, I had
rather pardon than condemn others. Normandie&mdash;who is so
great a friend of mine, that he is a great friend of yours also&mdash;will
furnish the best testimony as to what I think of your book.
I am only afraid that the involved style and tedious discussion
will obscure the light which is really in it. I know, and that
not without pleasure too, that nothing but what is excellent is
expected from you. I speak without flattery. Your book
seems to deserve a place among [works of] that class. But
because the readers of our time are so fastidious, and not possessed
of great acuteness, I should wish the language to be so
managed, that one might allure them by the fluency of his expression,
and bring forward at the same time, that erudition
which lies concealed under those coverings of which I have
spoken. This is my candid judgment. Although I prefer
acquiescing in the opinion of Viret, yet I could not be altogether
silent, seeing that you had already insisted on it for the second
time. Your brother will let you know about our affairs.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and very honest friend, with all your fellow-ministers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
especially Christopher, and Michael Faton. May
the Lord ever guide and watch over you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>First mention of Theodore Beza&mdash;poverty of Calvin's colleagues.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>5th September 1549.</i>
</p>

<p>I understand that Eustace, on his return, had some conversation
with you regarding two professors whom he knew about.
While some deference is due to the judgment of a pious and
learned man, yet I dare not trust it absolutely. Consider the
matter calmly, therefore, along with the brethren. For I have
promised that I will write to you in no other way than to give
you a faithful advice. The Piedmontese author of the long
epistle is no better known to me than to you; so we may wish
him well when he asks nothing more from us. I have written
to Farel my opinion of his book.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> But it happened, through
the negligence of his brother Claudius, that the letter was not
delivered; for after he had breakfasted with us, I retired to my
library, and he went away without saluting me. I have a
messenger here, however, who will, I hope, set out to-morrow.
Normandie can tell you how faithfully I endeavoured to send
Beza<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> to you. I do not care for mentioning others. Yea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the individual in question knows that I have entreated him
almost importunately. Should he return I will not cease to
urge him. The monks are wrong, however, in asserting that
my associates are wealthy. For the only one who may be
thought rich is involved in debt with three or four:&mdash;I mean
Cop. Abel and Des Gallars are rich in books; Bourgouin
and Raymond have excellent daughters, but nothing more.
But even if they do not speak to him, we will consult the good
of the Church rather than our regard for him. I think you
know of Renier's wishes; and I know that he is so beloved by
you and by the right-minded, that you will be especially
anxious to find work for him adapted to his capacity.</p>

<p>Adieu, most upright brother and friend, together with your
wife, your little daughter, and your whole family. May the
Lord keep you and guide you by his Spirit! Salute the
brethren earnestly in my name.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>A Reformer's complaints on the malevolence of the Bernese ministers.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th November 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>I beg you, my dear Haller, not to take it amiss that I ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
you to discharge the present duty for me, as I shall impose a
new burden on you, by and by, to provide, viz., for the transmission
of my letter to Zurich. Conrad Curio, who is at present
schoolmaster at Zurtolphi, got me to become security for
him with a certain bookseller. My reminding him of it has
been hitherto useless, and I am now pulling his ears a little
more smartly, lest I pay the penalty of his negligence. I send
a letter to be safely delivered to him at an early period, which
may be done without trouble to yourself. Had I not been
convinced of your love toward me, I should not have ventured
to impose any burden on you. Would that I had the same
confidence in all! But I see that Satan has too much influence
among those who wish to be regarded as ministers of Christ,
when Hotman<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> was lately refused a place among the deacons,
for which I can see no other reason than that he was for some
time my coadjutor. But although I am his familiar companion,
he ought not [on that account] to injure the pious and the
learned. Those unscrupulous individuals who go about raging
so wildly will never cause me to regret the labour which I
incur in behalf of the Church. They will assuredly bring
upon themselves equal odium and reproach from all good men.
I shall defer the rest for two days or four.</p>

<p>Adieu, distinguished sir, and very dear brother in Christ,
deserving of my regard. May the Lord guide you and your
family!&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Prohibition of the Vaudois Conferences&mdash;remonstrances on the intolerance of the
Bernese ministers towards those of France.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>28th Nov. 1549</i>.
</p>

<p>If your senate had reasons for forbidding the ministers to
assemble in future, according to their custom, to confer upon
the Scriptures, it seems to me that I have formed a correct
opinion of them. But I deny that this was a useful remedy.
I have heard that there were never any contentions at Lausanne
until that madman resolved upon perpetually harassing the
Church. Every one will admit that such meetings are an excellent
institution; and experience has hitherto shown that
they have not been without a tolerable amount of fruit. The
negligence of those who attend more to other things than to
sacred literature, is there best detected. Such are at least
stimulated by shame, and all derive benefit. It is certainly
unjust that for one man's fault&mdash;for the wantonness of one
idler&mdash;men are to be deprived of a beneficial exercise. It is
wronging the brethren also, to visit upon all the transgression
of one individual. Haller once saw an appearance of quarrelsome
wrangling. But who fanned the flame? who supplied
the fuel? It is well known that as long as Zebedee was allowed
to rage there with impunity, the brethren were harassed with
perpetual contentions.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Why was there not a check put to his
fury, as there might quickly have been? Whence arose his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
shameless audacity? If you do not know, there are too many
among ourselves who have helped thus to puff up his arrogance.
What now, if those very men, who long took advantage of his
rashness that they might continue to harass the brethren, are
the cause of the meetings being prohibited? When you inveigh
so bitterly against all the ministers of our country, you
seem to me to be forgetful both of your mildness and your
modesty. As those grievously err who, with the same chalk,
as they say, whiten the innocent and the guilty; so, where is
the justice of blackening all with the same coal? I admit the
great deficiencies of many, and I would that the proper amount
of strictness were exercised. I know that many are wicked,
wanton, and virulent; but, believe me, such are now permitted
to throw off the reins. In the meantime forgive me, if I am
indignant, that the whole French name is thus cruelly condemned.
Although I make no distinction of nations here, nor
am I one who shows indulgence to the vices of my friends,
yet it is natural that I should be better acquainted than you
are with their virtues. As to those scripture conferences
which have hitherto been customary, grant us at least that old
proverb, "Experience teaches fools." We have now for a long
time had sufficient proof that the brethren are benefited by the
exercise of this style of interpretation. Now the less the interchange
of opinion, the greater will be the danger from pernicious
dogmatisms. The slothful will sleep undisturbed;
many will somehow or other grow godless, or become degenerate.
This also has very great weight with me, that all good
men are groaning under this edict, and the wicked are rejoicing.
And when you see the College of Lausanne (to omit others)
suffering so much on this account, it is surely your duty to
alleviate their holy anxiety, as far as words can do so. In
other respects also, your being very closely united is not more
for their interest than for your own, if you wish to benefit the
Church of God. For, to be frank with you, I was vexed a
little lately by the rejection of Hotman, as I suspected that
my connection with him had done him harm.</p>

<p>From my confidence in your friendship, I expostulate the
more freely with you and my friend Haller. For I am persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that some things which trouble me are displeasing to
you also. But however that may be, I hope you will put a just
and friendly interpretation on these complaints. Adieu, most
excellent and accomplished man, and my revered brother in
the Lord. May God keep you and your family, and be ever
present with you and guide you!&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>I thought I had given this letter with others to the messenger,

late. I suppose you have not heard that the marriage of the
Duke of Mantua with the daughter of Ferdinand has been
celebrated at Papia. It is yet uncertain who is to succeed
Paul.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> War is expected in Italy. God grant that we may

<h3>Statement of leading articles of the Reformed Faith.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, ... [1549?]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Although I am personally unknown to you, still
I believe you will not think it strange that I make so bold as
to write to you, having been requested to do so by two persons
who ought to insure me free enough access,&mdash;I mean Monsieur
de Saint-Martin and your daughter. Wherefore, also, I shall forbear
making further excuses, and likewise because I have heard
that my letters would not be unwelcome to you, but that you
would have the patience to read and think over the contents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
which gives me good hope that you have the true seed of God in
you, which only needs to be cultivated in order to sprout and
produce its fruit. Now, as that is the end I propose to myself,
that we may attain it, I beseech you above all chiefly to consider,
that it is the duty of every Christian, not to consent to
the abuses which reign in the world, but rather to ascertain
what is the pure truth of God, with the purpose of adhering to
it; further, that you would listen to me, touching the doctrine
which we hold,&mdash;not that I would make full and entire declaration
of it to you, but I shall merely state in few words the
summary of the whole, in such wise that it will be easy for you
to perceive what is our principal object. As to the first, there
are very many who settle down in their ignorance and superstition,
because they will not take the trouble to open their eyes
when the clear light is presented to them. Inasmuch as I do
not hold you to be of that number, without further exhortation,
it suffices me that I have warned you of the fact. There
is much reason that all Christians should take care how they
live towards God, so as not wilfully to deceive themselves,
above all in a matter of such importance as is the salvation of
the soul. It is notorious that Christianity has been much corrupted
and depraved, as well by the negligence of prelates, as
by that of governors, and that by their stupidity, or avarice
and ambition. I do not consider that this corruption is only
in manners or morals, but what is worse, doctrine and truth
have been turned into a lie. The service of God has been polluted
by endless superstitions. The order of Church government
has been turned upside down, the signs and symbols of
the sacraments so jumbled together, that all is confusion. If
everybody does not perceive that, it is because they have not
brought back all things to the true standard; but if we compare
the religion and doctrine held under the Papacy, with the
pure ordinance of God, we shall therein discover more contradiction
than between day and night. Therefore, to form a
right notion, we must not pause to lay stress upon either the
authority of princes, or an ancient custom, or on one's own understanding,
but rather look above all, to what God has commanded
or forbidden, for he has not spoken in secret, but has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
desired that his will should be known both of great and small.
When you have once settled this point of submitting yourself
to be taught of God, to acquiesce in what his word contains,
desiring to know what is the right way of salvation, that will
be already a good step towards arriving at the full knowledge
of what it is for our advantage to know.</p>

<p>The second request that I have said I had to make, is that
you consider calmly the sum of our doctrine, when I shall have
shortly stated it to you; for there are many who at once reject
and condemn it, without having heard what it is, because they
are prejudiced against us, which warps their judgment. I pass
over the imputations and crimes which they lay against us, to
make us odious to all the world; but do what they will, they
cannot reproach us with having any other end than to gather
in the people who have long been going astray, and to bring
them back to their standard, which is the pure word of God.
We demand, however, that all differences of opinion be determined
by an appeal to that, and that every one abide by what
we know to be the will of God. Our adversaries make themselves
a buckler of the name of the Church, which they falsely
assume. And it is the same conflict which in their time the
prophets and apostles had with those who usurped pre-eminence
in the Church, belying in all things the duties of their
office. But we know that the Church is founded on the doctrine
of the prophets and apostles, and that she ought to be
united to Jesus Christ, her head, who is without variableness.
So therefore it is but a bastard church where God's doctrine
does not reign as the rule. Following that rule, we desire
that God may be served according to his commandments, and
we reject all new-fangled ways invented to suit the appetite of
men; for it is not lawful for men to impose law or statute upon
conscience, and God moreover has reserved to himself this
privilege, to ordain for us whatsoever seemeth good unto himself.
Therefore it is, that we are accused of having abolished
and trampled under foot the ordinances of our mother, holy
Church, for example when we say with Isaiah and Jesus Christ,
that it is in vain we think to find out God by means of human
traditions; then, when we say with St. James, that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
but one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Well,
then, when you had searched to the very utmost, you would
find that all which is among them called the worship of God,
is nothing but pure invention forged at their own pleasure. In
like manner, because the Holy Scripture, treating of our salvation,
and wherein rests our whole trust and confidence in
regard to it, sends us back to the sole grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, declaring that we are poor wretched sinners, utterly
lost and useless for good, we endeavour to bring all the world
to partake of this grace; and that it may be acknowledged and
magnified as it behoves to be, and which cannot be done without
casting down the false belief that we can do aught to merit
paradise. They take occasion on this account to accuse us of
making no account of good works, whereby they do us wrong;
for we are far more careful to recommend holy living, than are
any of our adversaries. But in order that men may not deceive
themselves by an overweening confidence, we teach that we are
able to do nothing whatever in our own strength, unless God
guides us by his Holy Spirit, and that even when we had done
all, this would afford a far too feeble ground whereon to found
our justification; that we must therefore have continual recourse
to the mercy of God, and to the merit and passion of Jesus
Christ; and that it is there that we must rest our hope, making
no account of all the rest. Thence it comes, that we say likewise,
that we ought to address God in all our prayers, for he calls
us to himself, and forasmuch as we of ourselves are too vile
and unworthy to draw near to him, he hath given us his Son
Jesus Christ for our Advocate. Therefore it is, that they reproach
us with our hostility to the saints of both sexes, and
that we forbid the honouring of them. But this is absurd, for
we render to the saints the honour which God assigns them.
Only we cannot bear that they should be made idols of, being
set up instead of God, or of his Son our Saviour, which besides
they do not ask, but on the contrary take to be a great wrong;
for those things which, under shadow of devotion, are done with
the view of pleasing them, they seek vengeance before God.</p>

<p>The sacraments, which ought to serve for our confirmation
in the truth of God and in his fear, have been strangely perverted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
When we set ourselves carefully to restore them to
their true use and first original, they would have it believed
that we are going to destroy them. But would they only look
to the ordinance as it has been instituted by the Master, it
would then be quite evident that the manner of observance
which we practise, does not derogate in anything from what
he has prescribed. True it is, we have not the mass as among
them, but we have the Supper such as Jesus Christ has left it
to us, and our adversaries can say nothing to the contrary, only
they object their custom as a reason for everything, but we
have another kind of buckler altogether, which is the commandment
that must endure inviolable to the end of the world.
<em>Do this</em>, saith the text, <em>until I come</em>. Whereby it follows, that
whosoever attempt to change anything until the coming of
our Lord Jesus, prove themselves rebels against him. I should
be over-tedious were I to follow out the other details which I
omit mentioning to you, because it shall well suffice me, if it
please God to lead you to concur in what I have herein lightly
handled, in the hope that by more ample reading you may be
yet more confirmed in the same purpose. And now, therefore,
Monsieur, having humbly commended me to your kind favour,
I beseech our good Lord to guide you by his Spirit, to make
you conformable in everything to his will, and to send what he
knows to be good and wholesome for you.&mdash;Your servant,</p>

<h3>Congratulations on the royal favour shown to the Duke of Somerset&mdash;use to be made
of his influence for spreading the Gospel in England.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>January 1550.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;That I have so long delayed to write to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
has been from no want of good-will, but to my great regret I
have refrained, fearing lest, during the troubles which have
been of late, my letters should be the occasion of annoyance. I
thank my God that he has now afforded me the opportunity
which hitherto I have been waiting for. It is not I alone who
rejoice at the good issue which God has given to your affliction,
but all true believers, who desire the advancement of the kingdom
of our Lord Jesus Christ, forasmuch as they know the
solicitude with which you have laboured for the re-establishing
of the Gospel in all its purity in England, and that every kind
of superstition might be abolished. And I do not doubt that
you are prepared to persevere in the same course, in so far as
you shall have the means. On your own part, Monseigneur,
not only have you to acknowledge the favour God has shown
you in stretching out his hand for your deliverance, but also
to bear his dealing with you in remembrance, that you may
profit by it.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> I know the regret which you may well entertain,
and how you may be tempted to render the like to those
whom you reckon to have meditated greater mischief against
you than what has come to pass. But you know the admonition
which Saint Paul has given us on that head, that is, that
we have not to fight against flesh and blood, but against the
hidden wiles of our spiritual enemy. Wherefore let us not
waste our energies upon men, but rather let us set ourselves
against Satan to resist all his machinations against us, as
there is no doubt whatever that he was the author of the evil
which impended over you, in order that the course of the
Gospel might thereby be hindered, and even that all should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
be brought to confusion. Therefore, Monseigneur, forgetting
and pardoning the faults of those whom you may conceive to
have been your enemies, apply your whole mind to repel his
malice who thus engaged them to their own destruction in setting
themselves to seek your ruin. This magnanimity will not
only be pleasing to God, but it will make you the more loved
among men; and I do not doubt that you have such regard to
that as you ought. But if your humane disposition itself impels
you to this course, so much the more may I be confident
that you will receive kindly what I say, knowing that nothing
induces me to tender such advice to you, but the love I bear
you, and the care which I have for your honour and welfare.
And besides, it is so difficult a virtue so to overcome our
passions as to render good for evil, that we can never be too
much exhorted to do so. Moreover, seeing that the Lord has
directed the issue so much better than many expected, keep in
mind, Monseigneur, the example of Joseph. It would be difficult
to find in our day such a mirror of integrity. For he,
seeing that God had turned to good the evil which they had
plotted against him, is unwearied in showing himself the minister
of the goodness of God towards his brethren who had
persecuted him. This victory will be more glorious than that
which God has already given you, when he saved and secured
your person, and your property, and your honours. However,
Monseigneur, you have also to consider that if God has been
pleased to humble you for a little while, it has not been without
a motive. For although you might be innocent in regard
to men, you know that before this great heavenly Judge there
is no one living who is not chargeable. Thus, then, it is that
the saints have honoured the rod of God, by yielding their neck,
and bowing low their head under his discipline. David had
walked very uprightly, but yet he confessed that it had been
good for him to be humbled by the hand of God. For which
reason, as soon as we feel any chastisement, of whatsoever kind
it may be, the first step should be to retire into ourselves, and
well to examine our own lives, that we may apprehend those
blessings which had been hidden from us: for sometimes too
much prosperity so dazzles our eyes, that we cannot perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
wherefore God chastises us. It is but reasonable that we
should do him at least as much honour as we would to a
physician, for it is his to heal our inward maladies, which are
unknown to ourselves, and to pursue a course of healing, not
according to our liking, but as he knows and judges to be
fitting. What is more, it must needs happen sometimes that
he makes use of preservative remedies, not waiting till we have
already fallen into evil, but preventing it before it comes. God,
besides your native rank, having assigned you a high dignity,
has performed great things by your hand, and which shall
possibly be more applauded after your death than they are
duly appreciated during your lifetime. Moreover, he has
caused his name to be magnified by you. Now, the most
virtuous and excellent persons are in greater danger than any
others of being tempted to forget themselves. You are aware,
Monseigneur, of what is written concerning the good King
Hezekiah, that after having performed such memorable actions,
as well for religion and the worship of God as for the common
weal of the country, his heart was lifted up. If God has been
pleased to prevent that in you, it is a special favour he
has shown you. Were there no other reason for it, save that
he would be glorified in your deliverance, and that he would
be recognized by you, as well as by all in your person, as the
true protector of his own, that alone ought to be all-sufficient
to you.</p>

<p>It remains, Monseigneur, that since he has thus given you
the upper hand, you do render homage to him for this benefit,
as is due. If we are recovered out of a dangerous sickness, we
ought to be doubly careful, and to honour this merciful God,
just as if he had bestowed a new life upon us. You may not
do less in your present circumstances. Your zeal to exalt the
name of God, and to restore the purity of his Gospel, has
been great. But you know, Monseigneur, that in so great and
worthy a cause, even when we have put forth all our strength,
we come very far short of what is required. However, if God,
in thus binding you to himself anew, has meant, in this way,
to induce you to do better than ever, your duty is to strive to
the uttermost and with all your energy, so that so holy a work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
as that which he has begun by you may be carried forward.
I doubt not that you do so; but I am also confident, that knowing
the affection which induces me to exhort you thereunto,
you will receive all my solicitation with your wonted benignity.
If the honour of God be thus esteemed by you above all else,
he will assuredly watch over you and your whole household,
to pour out his grace there more abundantly, and will make
you know the value of his blessing. For that promise can
never fail,&mdash;<em>Those who honour me, I will render honourable</em>.
True it is, that those who best do their duty are oftentimes
troubled the most by many violent onsets. But this is quite
enough for them, that God is at hand to succour and relieve
them. Now, although it is enough for you to look to God and
to feel the assurance that your service is pleasing to him, nevertheless,
Monseigneur, it is a great comfort to you to see the
king so well disposed that he prefers the restoration of the
Church, and of pure doctrine, to everything else, seeing it is a
virtue greatly to be admired in him, and a peculiar blessing for
the kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> that in a youth of such tender age the vanities
of this world do not hinder the fear of God and true religion
from ruling in his heart. This also ought to be a great help
and confirmation, that you discharge the principal service
which he desires and asks, in serving our heavenly King, the
Son of God.</p>

<p>Monseigneur, having very humbly commended me to your
kind favour, I beseech our good Lord, that, upholding you in
his holy keeping, he would increase in you yet more and more
the gifts of his Holy Spirit, for the furtherance of his own
glory, so that we may all have whereof to rejoice.</p>

<p>Your very humble servant,</p>

<h3>Tidings from Germany and England&mdash;recommendation of a domestic.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>1st February 1550</i>.
</p>

<p>Although you have not had a long letter from me for a considerable
time, yet I do not think that even now I have anything
new to write to you. All the time that our friend
Thomas was here, I was either suffering severely from a cough
or annoyed by catarrh. A violent headache is now tormenting
me, although it has been easier for the past hour. It is well
that I am not prevented from labouring, in a kind of way, to
discharge my necessary duties; but I usually make but slow
progress. Much of my time is wasted, at present, by ill health,
which ought to be devoted to useful labour. We hear nothing
from Germany, except that the Lord has punished the Emperor
by the destruction of some of his ships. Would that some
disease would put a check upon his evil deeds! You know
that the tutor of the English king has been set at liberty, and,
I suppose, you are aware also of what happened to my letter.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
The prefect of C&mdash;&mdash; having got it from the messenger took it
into the palace; he afterwards restored it to the messenger,
who, before giving it to the king's tutor, presented it to [the
Archbishop] of Canterbury, to ask his advice. He returned it
to him again after retaining it two days. The messenger, fearing
that that was done insidiously, or that he was bringing
upon his own head the very danger which others were so
anxiously avoiding, presented it to the King's Council, although,
as I hear, he was advised to do that by good and wise men.
I expect an answer immediately. Whatever may turn up, I
shall see to it that you be made acquainted with it.</p>

<p>Whether it is owing to the indolence of John Girard that
your book is not yet printed,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> or from the confused state of his
affairs at home, or because he has made deliberate choice of
many things before it, I dare not affirm. I have certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
spoken to him frequently on the matter, and he has made
serious protestations about it. Normandie also has repeatedly
ordered him to get on with it. So the <cite>Institute</cite>, which should
have been completed a month ago, is not finished yet. I wished
to make this brief statement to you, to let you know that I
had not been neglectful. He is not particularly moved by my
reproving him, except that he immediately promises to do it
forthwith.</p>

<p>Adieu, brother and very worthy friend. May the Lord by
his Spirit continue to guide you, and may he watch over you
and your family! You will salute your fellow-ministers
cordially in my name, especially Faton and your colleague.</p>

<p>The short Treatise on the Sanctification of the Infants of
Pious Parents, and on Female Baptism, is being printed,
although it did not require more than two days' labour.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> As
to what you fear of the venomous creatures which I have irritated
giving forth some poison, I am quite easy on that score.
Adieu again.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>I understand that you require a maid-servant,&mdash;neither yourself
nor your brothers told me so. However, having heard it
from others, I wish to tell you that there is a woman here who
is pious, upright, and careful, and advanced in years, who
would gladly serve you if she could be of use to you.</p>

<p>All your friends salute you kindly, especially M. Normandie,
yet this does not detract from the regard of the others&mdash;from
that of Verron, for instance, the writer of the present

<h3>Election of a new Pope.</h3>

<p>I am glad that worthy man has at length so far listened to
rational advice as to yield to you. One must overlook what
difficulty he occasioned for some time, only he should try to
make up for his slowness by assiduity when he has once arrived.
This I expect he will be entirely prepared to do. For
I know him to be an upright man and one who is diligent in
his business. I know that he will be so commended to you
that there is no need of words [from me.] His wife will get
accustomed to it by degrees. He brings two boys with him,
of whom the one is the son of a very excellent and very upright
man, the other is a grandson of Pommier's brother. When
they reach you, let them understand that you will attend to
them. I shall faithfully discharge my duty to the son of M.
Michael Schalter. I have just now received your letter.</p>

<h3>Counsels and encouragements&mdash;collection of commentaries on Isaiah by Des Gallars.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>7th March 1550</i>.
</p>

<p>I am happy that you have returned safely from England.
If your affairs here are satisfactory and prosperous, and the
Lord is providing you with employment, I am the more delighted,
although, as matters now stand everywhere, it becomes
us so to walk in the world that we may be willing forthwith to
depart. England seems as yet unsettled. Elsewhere, whatever
was satisfactorily established appears now to decay. So
that, unless we can preserve our patience, we shall nowhere
find the aspect of affairs so pleasing as to prevent us from longing
for a change. This is every day more and more the
experience of myself, whose struggle you suppose is almost concluded.
For I am perpetually disturbed by new contentions,
and new sources of annoyance and disgust, to such a degree,
that, were a free choice allowed me, I would prefer any lot to
groaning continually under so grievous a burden. The Lord
has adorned you with genius and learning; he has gifted you
with a zealous and magnanimous spirit. We must pray that
he will not suffer these rich endowments to lie unimproved.
I know, indeed, that hitherto you have endeavoured to make
your life useful to the Church, and that your attempts have not
been without fruit. But I desire that your gifts may be more
fully displayed, and I trust that they will. My meditations on
Isaiah, which you say are expected, will shortly be published.
The composition of the work, however, is Des Gallars', for, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
have but little time for writing, he jots down to my dictation
and arranges his materials afterwards at home. I then make
a revision of it, and wherever he has missed my meaning I
restore it. When my letter reaches you, I expect the treasurer
of our city will be there also, and will remain for two days. If
you have any news he will be glad to convey them. I have
nothing to say to MM. Myconius and Sulzer till they answer
my last. Remember me, however, to them and to Oporinus.
My colleagues desire me to salute you cordially. I pray for
all joy and prosperity to your wife wherever she is.</p>

<p>Adieu, illustrious sir. May the Lord continue to guide you
by his Spirit, and be ever present with you!&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Settlement of the Colladon family at Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>12th May 1550.</i>
</p>

<p>I have at present no other reason for writing you than that
I thought it absurd that a messenger, sent with difficulty hither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
from so intimate a friend, and on business well known to me,
should return without a letter from me. I was afraid, also,
at the same time, lest your brother should entertain unpleasant
suspicions should he hear that I had been altogether silent.
My friend Laurent at present declines the journey to which
you urge him; his excuse is brief, but such as we both hope
will abundantly satisfy you. I will only add this from him,
that he was as far as possible from seeking any excuse for not
visiting you. I assure you that his inclination is in no respect
altered; but having seriously pondered the whole matter, I
dare not advise him to leave his home at present. It is well,
however, that those with whom you invited him to confer are
disposed to entertain a removal.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> And, indeed, they can accomplish
nothing in this affair without coming to us. For as
the girl is engaged in marriage here,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> it would be too hazardous
for them to remain at home. It will be your duty, therefore,
to urge them to collect their baggage, and prepare for the
journey. This may at first sight appear ridiculous, as if, in a
matter so difficult and perplexing, I fancied everything was
easily managed. I am not so inexperienced, however, as to be
ignorant of the obstacles, embarrassments, and delays with
which you must struggle. This only I wish, since the matter
admits of no delay, that you would exert yourself vigorously
in discharging your duty.</p>

<p>Adieu, beloved brother in the Lord. Salute your relatives
kindly in my name, both the father and all the families. May
God direct you with the Spirit of wisdom and fortitude; may
he be present with you and further all your pious efforts!
Amen.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Notice of a publication attributed to Gruet.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>May 1550.</i>]
</p>

<p>Seeing that it has pleased Messieurs to ask my opinion regarding
the book of Gruet, it appears to me, that in the first
place, they ought in regular judicial form to identify the handwriting,
not so much for the condemnation of the individual,
who is quite enough condemned already, as for the consequences
which may ensue; as well in order that it may not
be thought that they have been lightly moved on account of
an uncertain book, as for the sake of adherents and accomplices.</p>

<p>That being done, I think that the suppression of the book
itself ought not to appear to be for the sake of burying it out
of sight, but be accompanied by a testimony that they had
looked upon it with such detestation as it deserved, and that
it was done for the sake of example only.</p>

<p>It is true, that seeing we ought to abstain from all filthy
communication, and that nothing of that kind ought to proceed
out of our mouth,&mdash;such blasphemous and execrable speeches
ought not to be repeated, as if we had no horror of them at all;
but, in obedience to the rule which our Lord has given in his
law, it is for the common weal that faithful magistrates specially
define the impieties which they punish. Besides, Messieurs
are well aware how necessary it is, for many reasons
which I leave for them to consider, although God's ordinance
regarding it ought to be all-sufficient for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The form, under correction, which we should recommend,
is that there should be a preamble or narrative something like
what follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That whereas, in such a year, and on such a day, Jacques
Gruet, as well on account of hideous blasphemies against God,
and mockery of the Christian religion, as because of wicked
conspiracy against the public state of this city, mutinies and
other crimes and malpractices, had been condemned to such a
punishment, it has since come to pass that a book has been
found in his own handwriting, as has been ascertained upon
sufficient evidence, in which are contained many blasphemies,
so execrable, that there is no human creature who ought not
to tremble at the hearing of them, and wherein he makes a
mock at the whole of Christianity, so far as to say of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Son of God and King of Glory, before whose
majesty the devils are constrained to bow down themselves,
that he was an idle beggar, a liar, a fool, a seducer, a mischievous
wicked person, an unhappy fanatic, a clown full of
vain-glorious and wicked presumption, who well deserved to
be crucified; that the miracles which he had performed were
nought but sorceries and apish tricks, and that he deemed
himself to be the Son of God, in like manner as the Hierarchs
weened themselves to be in their Synagogue; that he played
the hypocrite, having been hung as he deserved, and died
miserably in his folly, a thoughtless coxcomb, great drunkard,
detestable traitor, and suspended malefactor, whose coming
into the world has brought nothing but all sorts of wickedness,
disaster, and confusion, and every sort of reproach and
outrage which it is possible to invent:</p>

<p>He has said of the Prophets, that they have been only fools,
dreamers, fanatics; of the Apostles, that they were rascals, and
knaves, apostates, dull blockheads, brainless fellows; of the
Virgin Mary, that it is rather to be presumed that she was a
strumpet; of the law of God, that it is worthless, like those
who have framed it; of the Gospel, that it is nothing but falsehood;
that the whole of Scripture is false and wicked, and that
there is less meaning in it than there is in Æsop's fables, and
that it is a false and foolish doctrine:</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>And not only does he thus villanously attack our holy and
sacred Christian religion, but he also renounces and abolishes
all religion and divinity, saying that God is nothing, representing
men to be like to the brute beasts, denying eternal
life, and disgorging execrations, the like of which ought to
make the hair stand up upon the head of every one, and which
are of such rank infection as to bring a whole country under
the curse, so that all people of every degree, having any sound
conscience at all, ought to ask pardon of God that his name
has been thus blasphemed among them.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it appears to me that sentence ought to be
given in such or similar form as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>That whereas the writer of the said book has been, by judicial
sentence, condemned and executed, yet, in order that the
vengeance of God may not abide upon us for having suffered
or concealed such horrible impiety, and also as an example to
all accomplices and adherents of a sect so infectious and worse
than diabolical, even to shut the mouth of all those who would
excuse or cover such enormities, and to show them what condemnation
they deserve, Messieurs have ordained ... &amp;c....</p>

<p>The sooner this is done the better, for already this unhappy
book has been too much in the hands of these gentlemen....</p>

<h3>Controversies excited in Germany by the establishment of <cite>the Interim</cite>&mdash;Brotherly
reproofs.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<i>18th June 1550.</i>]
</p>

<p>The ancient satirist once said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Si natura negat, facit indignatio versum."
</p>

<p>It is at present far otherwise with me. So little does my present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
grief aid me in speaking, that it rather renders me almost
entirely speechless. Besides, as I cannot express in words how
my mind is affected, being overcome with merely thinking on
the subject on which I am about to write, I am almost struck
dumb. I would have you suppose me to be groaning rather
than speaking. It is too well known, from their mocking and
jests, how much the enemies of Christ were rejoicing over your
contests with the theologians of Magdeburg.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> They certainly
presented a foul and abominable spectacle, as well to the Lord
and the angels, as to the whole Church. If no blame attaches
to you in this matter, my dear Philip, it would be but the dictate
of prudence and justice, to devise a means of curing the
evil, or at least of somewhat mitigating it. Yet, forgive me if
I do not consider you altogether free from blame. And from
this you may conjecture how severe the judgments of others
are concerning you, and how offensive and unpleasant their
remarks. In the mean while, let it be well understood, that in
openly admonishing you, I am discharging the duty of a true
friend; and if I employ a little more severity than usual, do
not think that it is owing to any diminution of my old affection
and esteem for you. Although for me to offend by rude simplicity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
rather than bespeak by adulation the favour of any man,
is nothing uncommon or new to you. I also feel, on the other
hand, less anxiety about your taking it amiss to be reproved by
me when I have just cause for displeasure, inasmuch as I am
well aware that nothing gives you greater pleasure than open
candour. I am truly anxious to approve all your actions, both
to myself and to others. But I at present accuse you before
yourself, that I may not be forced to join those who condemn
you in your absence. This is the sum of your defence: that
provided purity of doctrine be retained, externals should not
be pertinaciously contended for.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> And if it be true that is
confidently asserted everywhere, you extend the distinction of
non-essentials too far. You are not ignorant that the Papists
have corrupted the worship of God in a thousand ways. We
have put up with corruptions which were barely tolerable.
The ungodly now order these same things to be restored, that
they may triumph over a down-trodden gospel. And if any
one does not hesitate to oppose this, will you not ascribe it to
pertinacity? Every one knows how this is opposed to your
modesty. If you are too facile in making concessions, you need
not wonder if that is marked as a fault in you by many.
Moreover, several of those things which you consider indifferent,
are obviously repugnant to the word of God. Perhaps
there are some who insist too positively on certain points, and,
as usually happens in disputes, make offensive attacks upon
some things which have little harm in themselves. Truly if I
have any understanding in divine things, you ought not to have
made such large concessions to the Papists; partly because you
have loosed what the Lord has bound in his word, and partly
because you have afforded occasion for bringing insult upon the
Gospel. At a time when circumcision was as yet lawful, do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
you not see that Paul, because crafty and malicious fowlers
were laying snares for the liberty of believers, pertinaciously refused
to concede to them a ceremony at the first instituted by
God? Accordingly, he boasts that he did not yield to them,
no not for a moment, that the truth of the Gospel might remain
intact among the Gentiles. In our day, indeed, the enemy has
not troubled us about circumcision, but that they may not leave
us anything pure, they are tainting both doctrine and every
exercise of worship with their putrid leaven. As for the theologians
of Magdeburg, you say that they were only raising disputes
about a linen vesture. I do not see the force of this. I
certainly think the use of the linen vesture, with many other
fooleries, has been hitherto retained as much by you as by
them. And, indeed, good and pious men everywhere deplore
that you should have countenanced those corruptions which
manifestly tend to destroy the purity of all doctrine, and to undermine
the stability of the Church. Lest you may perhaps
have forgotten what I once said to you, I now remind you of
it, namely, that we consider our ink too precious if we hesitate
to bear testimony in writing to those things which so many of
the flock are daily sealing with their blood. I spoke thus,
indeed, at a time when we seemed to be farther out of the reach
of missiles [than at present]. And seeing that the Lord led us
forth into the arena, it became us on that account to strive the
more manfully. Your position is different from that of many,
as yourself are aware. For the trepidation of a general or
leader is more dishonourable than the flight of a whole herd of
private soldiers. Accordingly, while the timidity of others may
be overlooked, unless you give invariable evidence of unflinching
steadfastness, all will say that vacillation in such a man
must not be tolerated. You alone, by only giving way a little,
will cause more complaints and sighs than would a hundred
ordinary individuals by open desertion. And, although I am
fully persuaded that the fear of death never compelled you in
the very least to swerve from the right path, yet I am apprehensive
that it is just possible, that another species of fear may
have proved too much for your courage. For I know how
much you are horrified at the charge of rude severity. But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
must remember, that reputation must not be accounted by the
servants of Christ as of more value than life. We are no better
than Paul was, who held fearlessly on his way through "evil
and good report." It is indeed a hard and disagreeable thing
to be reckoned turbulent and inflexible,&mdash;men who would rather
see the whole world in ruin, than condescend to any measure of
moderation. But your ears should have been deaf to such talk
long ago. I have not so bad an opinion of you, nor will I do
you the injustice, to suppose that you resemble the ambitious,
and hang upon the popular breath. Yet I have no doubt but
that you are occasionally weakened by those goadings. What?
Is it the part of a wise and considerate man to rend the Church
for the sake of minute and all but frivolous matters? Must
not peace be purchased at any tolerable amount of inconvenience?
What madness is it to stand out for everything to the
last, to the neglect of the entire substance of the Gospel!
When lately these and similar remarks were circulated by designing
men, I thought and perceived you to be more influenced
by them than you should have been; accordingly, I open my
mind candidly to you, lest anything should mar that truly
divine magnanimity, which, in other respects, I know you to
possess. You know why I am so vehement. I had rather die
with you a hundred times, than see you survive the doctrines
surrendered by you. Nor do I say this as if there was danger
lest the truth of God made known by your ministry should
come to nought, or as if I distrusted your steadfastness; but
simply because you will never be sufficiently solicitous lest the
wicked obtain an occasion of cavilling, which owing to your
facileness they eagerly snatch at. Pardon me for loading your
breast with these miserable, though ineffectual groans. Adieu,
most illustrious sir, and ever worthy of my hearty regard. May
the Lord continue to guide you by his Spirit, and sustain
you by his might; may his protection guard you. Amen.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>

<p>When some one or other informed me lately that you intended
coming here in a short time, I snatched eagerly at the
intelligence, just as if you had been bound to come by a previous
agreement. If you do think of coming, I beseech you,
again and again, to stay a Sabbath with us, for you could not
have a better opportunity during the whole year. You will
deliver a discourse in the city on the morning of the Lord's

and rusticate till Thursday with Seigneurs Pommier and De
Lisle. On Friday, if you choose to make an excursion to
Tournet or Belle Rive, you will have my company also. You
need not be afraid of any unpopularity, for matters have calmed
down somewhat, as you will hear. See you do not disappoint
me. Certainly many here are expecting you.</p>

<h3>Opinion regarding Vergerio&mdash;intelligence regarding Bucer&mdash;letter to Melanchthon&mdash;disputes
with Berne&mdash;literary publications of Calvin.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>July 1550.</i>
</p>

<p>Although I have not been able to secure a messenger for a
long time, who might convey my letter to you with convenience
and safety, yet I must really confess that I am ashamed
of my long delay. But you will readily excuse me; and I can
with truth declare, that I would gladly have written you on
different occasions had I been able sooner to find a messenger.
It is not expedient for us, in my opinion, to be anxious about
our exculpation with the people of Zurich, lest some groundless
suspicion should steal in upon them. We shall see by and
by whether they have any faith in those clouds of theirs. Defence
will be easy then. Let us in the meantime cherish our
unanimity. Vergerio, Bishop of Pola,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> is here at present; he
will not return to the Grisons, however. I think Viret wrote
you concerning him. He came by Lausanne, and spent a few
days in familiar intercourse with the brethren. There is
much that is praiseworthy about him; and I hope that he
will be steadfast in the right path. As I knew he passed
through Zurich, I endeavoured to elicit from him whether he
had heard of aught unfavourable there. I could not scent out
anything, however. We should therefore keep quiet, unless a
better opportunity presents itself. Those who come from
England, say that matters get on well there. I have heard
nothing of Bucer, except that he seems rather pliant to some.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
There is a fixed opinion in the minds of many regarding him
which is not easily rooted out. It is not unlikely that the good
man feels annoyed by this prejudice. And whether he affords
any occasion for it or not, I cannot tell. We shall have some
word soon. No change has taken place in Saxony as yet.
Should you feel disposed to spend a quarter of an hour, perhaps,
in reading an epistle in which I discuss [the question] of
ceremonies, you will find a copy of it enclosed. I have written
to Melanchthon also in almost the very same strain, but, owing
to my negligence, it turns out that I do not possess a copy of
it.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Should you also be inclined to look into those points on
which I recently advised the Protector of England, I have sent
that [document] also. Would that time had allowed me to
seek your advice, rather than show you what I have now done
regarding the matter. The Collector of Finance<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> of the French
king, who was in prison, has cost us no further trouble. The
Bernese ambassadors, lately sent in his behalf, were of some
use, though of less than I could have wished. They succeeded,
however, in quieting the mind of the king. Five or six days
after there comes a most polite letter, in which the king returns
us his thanks, and courteously asks us to release the captive.
This was done. By the wonderful goodness of God, we are
now freed from a source of anxiety which often robbed me of
my sleep. That new impost which the Bernese are exacting,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
annoys us sadly. We are resolved not to pay it. We wish
it tried at law; our opponents wish us to bow to their authority.
Thereupon one evil rises out of another. Moreover, this
awkward circumstance attends it, that I dare not refuse my
advice to those soliciting it. I commenced Genesis seven days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
ago; may it be auspicious! In the meantime Isaiah is called
to press.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The printers are at present busy with Paul, but I
fear they have been longer of beginning than they should.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> If
it be not out in nine days hence, it will have other companions,
for I hope that the book <cite>De Scandalis</cite> and the <cite>Canonical
Epistles</cite> will be printed during the coming winter. Adieu, most
upright brother, ever to be revered by me in the Lord. Salute
earnestly your family and all the brethren. May the Lord
watch over you all and guide you by his Spirit!</p>

<h3>Exhortation to the study of the Scriptures.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>24th July 1550.</i>
</p>

<p>Although we have been unknown to each other by sight, yet
since you recognize the Master Christ in my ministry, and submit
yourself cheerfully and calmly to his teaching, this is a
sufficient reason why I should, on the other hand, esteem you
as a brother and fellow-disciple. But, as I understand from
your letter, that it is not very long since the Lord shed the
light of his gospel on you, I could not give a fitter expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of my love towards you, than by exhorting and encouraging
you to daily exercises. For we see sparks of piety immediately
disappear which had shone forth on many occasions; because,
instead of increasing the flame, they rather extinguish what
little light the Spirit of God had enkindled in them, by the
empty allurements of the world, or the irregular desires of the
flesh. That nothing of this kind may happen to you, you
must first of all give devoted submission to the will of the
Lord, and in the next place, you must fortify yourself by his
sacred doctrines. But as this is too extensive a theme to be
embraced in a letter, it is better for you to draw from the
fountain-head itself. For if you make a constant study of the
word of the Lord, you will be quite able to guide your life to
the highest excellence. You have faithful commentaries, which
will furnish the best assistance. I wish very much you could
find it convenient at some time to pay us a visit; for, I flatter
myself, you would never regret the journey. Whatever you
do, see that you follow the Lord, and at no time turn aside
from the chief end.</p>

<h3>Publication of the book on <cite>Scandals</cite>&mdash;persecution by the King of France&mdash;Bucer's
discouragement.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>19th August 1550</i>.
</p>

<p>How I am to repay you for your letter, I know not, unless
that, as soon as the Lord shall have enabled me to complete
the first three chapters of my Commentary on <cite>Genesis</cite>, I give
you a reading of it. If it please you, it will be worth the
trouble of plucking the fruit before the time; and besides, I
shall have the benefit of your judgment on the remainder of the
context, if you should think there is anything of which I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
be made aware. The pamphlet <cite>De Scandalis</cite>, considering the
immense fulness of the proof, will be not only short but even
concise.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> But then the evidence is all traced back to this conclusion,&mdash;that
there is no reason why ungodly men should
bring the Gospel into disrepute, and expose it to popular
odium, under the pretext of stumblingblocks; and that the
weak should be strengthened, in order that by the firmness
of their faith they may overcome whatever stumblingblocks
Satan may cast in their way. To put so great a check upon
error, that should any one turn aside from the right path, or
stumble or be disheartened, he may be without excuse. Yet
I show at the same time, how dreadful a vengeance God will
take on the authors of offences. Meanwhile, you will attack
that monster when the signs are favourable, which I confidently
trust you have already done.</p>

<p>Whatever good hopes of Henry, Viret led you to cherish,
they were vain.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Rumours of this sort are daily afloat. We
should, therefore, place no more reliance on them than they
deserve. It is a sure enough token that the ferocity of the
beast is in no degree appeased, when our brethren, so far from
experiencing any alleviation of their sufferings, are more closely
pursued every day. <span class="smcap">Another lion</span> is said to be making certain
extraordinary exertions.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> We should, therefore, ask God
to subdue their rage, or, at all events, to waste their strength
by mutual collision&mdash;as he has hitherto done&mdash;that they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
not be able to do any more damage. I am not ignorant of the
danger from which the Lord has extricated us. Nor need we
thank that abandoned faction, truly, for not bringing this
unfortunate, nay devoted, city into utter ruin. But as I had
all along good hopes of a remedy, nothing gave me great
alarm.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that I shall gain some ill-will on account of
the taxes.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> For they know that Normandie and I are consulted
[on the matter]. I prefer running this risk, however,
to allowing those to ruin themselves whom I ought to advise.
I was not able to bring them to a friendly agreement. All I
could do was, to point out to them the best course.</p>

<p>My dear Christopher,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> confessing as you do in the beginning
of your letter, that you are not standing firm in the faith, I am
astonished at your refusing to think about the state into which
you have fallen. Are you and Mirabeau to be here, then, at
Whitsuntide or not? I shall write to my godmother concerning
her little daughter at my earliest opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The
whole of yesterday was spent in some trifling manner, I hardly
know how.</p>

<p>I return to you again, my dear Farel. I do not know whether
you have sent Bucer's letter to Viret. Anyhow, I have
gathered from it that the worthy man is labouring under too
much moroseness at present.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> I shall write him a quiet letter
by and by. There will be silence in future concerning the
Zurichers; for I perceive that it only heightens his exasperation.
Seeing that he longs greatly for your [letter], I should
like him to approve of mine. For that saying of Terence's
applies to him, that the unfortunate abuse everybody. For
he makes no secret of thinking, that his old friends neglect him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
when they do not write frequently. Nor is he deceived in
Sturm, perhaps, who formerly stood so high in his favour that
he would have wronged most men before him.</p>

<p>Adieu, brethren, both very dear to me. May the Lord be
always present with you, to guide and watch over you.&mdash;Amen.
I was more tedious than I imagined on Saturday. For I did
not wish to give [the letter] to Latern just when I had it ready.
But, having striven in vain to reconcile him to his wife, I sent
them both away, not without considerable displeasure.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>State of religion in England&mdash;Calvin's literary labours&mdash;arrival of Robert Stephens
at Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>10th November 1550</i>.
</p>

<p>As for the circumstances of the English king, I simply
charged Hugo to inform you, that the success of the Gospel in
that country was highly gratifying. The French and the
Germans are allowed to adopt the plain and simple mode of
administering the sacraments, practised by us. So well disposed
was the King himself to religious matters, that he showed
some kindness even to me. But as you will learn all this better
from the letter of Utenhoven, I shall not add more.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
hardly any communication with the other brother, for having
gone out of the church with him, I met by accident the
syndic Corné, with whom I walked on, and while doing so,
the worthy man slipped away, and did not again make his
appearance. I am afraid he may have taken it amiss that I
neglected him for the syndic. But you can easily excuse the
thing, although an excuse is hardly needed. But to return
to England. You will gather from the same source certain
other things, of one of which, I must truly confess, I can by
no means approve; viz., that John Laski can be so much
influenced by the slightest breezes of court favour; I fear its
winds will drive him in all directions.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> I have not as yet
made bold to stir up the King himself. As certain parties
have repeatedly urged me,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> I have at last resolved upon dedicating
Isaiah to him; and as I thought there would be room
enough for an overplus, I intend adding to it a second work,
viz., the <cite>Canonical Epistles</cite>, which was conjoined with the
former, and which will be out at the same time. I shall accordingly
inscribe his name on both works.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>In truth, that on the Acts and on Genesis, of which you remind
me, can scarcely be said to have any existence yet. I
am ashamed of my slow progress with the Acts; and the third
part which has been completed will, I expect, make a large
volume. I was compelled to lay Genesis aside for some time.
The revisal of the New Testament has kept me busy for
four months past. I am dragged reluctantly into a considerable
part of the Old Testament also. I had reminded our
printers, in time, to select persons for themselves who, unlike
me, were fit for and would undertake the work. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
not attended to my hint, and so their neglect is now my punishment.
I have got Louis de Budé<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> to undertake David,
Solomon, and the history of Job, but as he will assist me only
with his own labour, he will not entirely rid me of annoyance.
I have rolled over the Apocrypha on Beza. What could I
do? Many are wanting Bibles to themselves, and it is long
since there was a single copy to be had. There is no one to
undertake the burden, so the horse's housings fall to the ox.
Some time has been expended also on the French version of
the treatise <cite>De Scandalis</cite>. But I am annoying you to no purpose
with these trifles; and, in truth, if I had to give you a
reason for so doing, I could only deal in absurdities. I can
truly affirm this, however, that it was not without shame that
I read that part of your letter in which you laud my industry,
being abundantly conscious of my own sloth and tardiness.
May the Lord enable me, creeping along gradually, to
be in some manner useful....</p>

<p>I have not received a letter from Bucer for a long time.
What Vergerio is doing I know not, except that he wrote me
from Zurich, with certain reasons for not returning at once
to his own church. My only fear is that he will have enough
to do, as you know the restless disposition of those people.
Robert Stephens<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> is now entirely ours, and we shall soon hear
what storms his departure has raised at Paris. The retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
philosophers will doubtless be quite insane.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> If the Lord
will, I shall pay you a visit early in spring, since I did
not go during the last vintage season, which I hoped, and
particularly desired, to do. My colleagues, Normandie and
his sister, one of the Budés, who is here, (for John has gone
to France for his father-in-law,) Trier, one of the Colladons&mdash;all,
salute you most lovingly and cordially; so do very
many others. Present my best regards to my countryman
Christopher, to Michael Faton, and to your own family; nor
do I wish to forget Mirabeau. Be not surprised that the sea
of Scandals is wellnigh drunk up by the draughts I have
taken of it. Be it known, also, that I was afraid to attempt
exhausting it, lest I should drain it dry. May the Lord preserve
you long in safety, and may he ever bless your labours.&mdash;Yours,</p>

feel always assured of your good-will, even had you not said

<h3>Explanations on the subject of the abolition of the great festivals at Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>2d January 1551</i>.
</p>

<p>I desire you, my dear Haller, not to measure my affection
for you by my not writing to you and to our friend Musculus,
of late, to lighten the domestic affliction under which you both
laboured.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> There is no need for my occupying many words in
expressing how anxious I was about your danger, from the time
that I heard of your houses being visited by the plague. But
as this remembrance should not be more pleasing to kind-hearted
and considerate men than the duty of writing, I trust
that when I inform you that my silence did not by any means
arise from neglect, I shall fully satisfy you both. The reason
why I did not write you is this: a report lately reached this
place regarding your calamity, but I could not accurately ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the extent of its progress. Accordingly, I did not venture
to take any active measures; I preferred having recourse to
prayer; this I knew both to be more necessary for you, and to
be desired by you. Besides the abolition of the feast-days here
has given grievous offence to some of your people, and it is
likely enough that much unpleasant talk has been circulating
among you. I am pretty certain, also, that I get the credit of
being the author of the whole matter, both among the malevolent
and the ignorant. But as I can solemnly testify that it was
accomplished without my knowledge, and without my desire, so
I resolved from the first rather to weaken malice by silence,
than be over-solicitous about my defence. Before I ever
entered the city, there were no festivals but the Lord's day.
Those celebrated by you were approved of by the same public
decree by which Farel and I were expelled; and it was rather
extorted by the tumultuous violence of the ungodly, than decreed
according to the order of law. Since my recall, I have
pursued the moderate course of keeping Christ's birth-day as
you are wont to do. But there were extraordinary occasions of
public prayer on other days; the shops were shut in the morning,
and every one returned to his several calling after dinner.
There were, however, in the meanwhile, certain inflexible individuals
who did not comply with the common custom from
some perverse malice or other. Diversity would not be tolerated
in a rightly constituted church: even for citizens not to live on
good terms with one another, would beget mistrust among
strangers. I exhorted the Senate to remove this disagreement
in future by a proper remedy. And indeed, I lauded, at the
same time, in express terms, the moderation which they had
hitherto exercised. I afterwards heard of the abrogation, just
as a perfect stranger would. Would that N.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> had acted less
ambitiously on former occasions! For feast-days might have
been abolished in that entire province. In order that those
four might return to their old condition and former privileges,
he contended as keenly against all the French-speaking pastors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
as if he had been acting for the good of the Church. You
would have said that Victor was doing battle with the Orientals
in behalf of his Easter. When I once asked him why circumcision
had a right to more honour than the death of Christ,
he was compelled to be silent. But let us forget the past. I
am satisfied with having indicated briefly the cause of so sudden
a change among us. Although I have neither been the mover
nor instigator to it, yet, since it has so happened, I am not sorry
for it. And if you knew the state of our Church as well as I
do, you would not hesitate to subscribe to my judgment. Let
me say this, however, that if I had got my choice, I should not
have decided in favour of what has now been agreed upon.
Yet there is no reason why men should be so much provoked,
if we use our liberty as the edification of the Church demands;
just as, on the contrary, it is not fair to take a prejudice against
our custom.</p>

<p>Adieu, very excellent sir and brother, deserving of my hearty
regard. Salute your colleagues, I pray you, and Mr. Nicolas
Zerkinden, in my name. My brethren salute you and those
aforementioned, very heartily. May the Lord by his Spirit
rule over you, preserve you, and bless you in all things. Amen.</p>

<h3>Criticism of a mandate published by the Seigneurs of Berne.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>4th January 1551.</i>
</p>

<p>What else can we say, my dear Viret, of those men destitute
of the Spirit of God, but that they have lost their wits? For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
from that very trivial circumstance in which they have betrayed
their infatuation, we conjecture what violent decrees
they would have passed if matters should ever come to a serious
issue. I have no doubt but the taunt of some Papist, rashly
uttered over his cups, has so stunned them, that they have immediately
hatched this mode of propitiating them. But in their
zeal to gratify the Papists, not only do they indulge them with
a permission to take rash oaths, but they even urge superstitious
people on, as if by the blast of a trumpet, to taking these
oaths. For how many will be found who, for the sake of incurring
this penalty, will spontaneously and deliberately
commit the offence? For my own part, I am of opinion, that
before the edict is promulgated, you should not fail to repair
thither. If the prefect, having received the order, should urge
you to publish it, James, in your absence, will petition him to
put it off till this return. For should you betake yourself
thither, by private conferences with your friends you will gain
more than if ten deputations were sent out. Nevertheless,
unless you insist strenuously by well-timed entreaties, you
yourself will not obtain much success. Meanwhile you will
have to put in practice the artifice of leaving free to them and
untouched whatever they may have resolved to expedite in
the city. One thing, however, you will take care to point out
to them, that their purposes cannot be effected in this province.
For I am in hopes that ere long they will repent of their
thoughtlessness. For the present what has dropped from them
so inconsiderately, in the first burst of their passion, they will
wish to defend. Beware then of going one step further than
seeing that they put in execution the article about prayer in the
French edicts. Respecting the abrogation of feast days<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> in our
city, I doubt not but scandalous speeches are bandied about
there. I told our brother Beza, when he lately visited us, that
that edict had been framed without my knowledge, and even
without a desire on my part for anything of the kind. As I
cannot, however, escape being considered as the author of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
why should I not quietly treat with contempt all unfavourable
judgments on that point? I have sent to you an unsealed
letter for Haller. If you think proper, you may take a copy
of it, and shew it to Farel on his return. Farewell, my most
excellent brother; salute your wife and daughters for me.
I am happy that everything goes on well at home. May the
Lord preserve you long in this prosperous state, and bless
your labours. You will present my best wishes to the
brethren. My colleagues and most of the brethren desire to
be kindly remembered to you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Explanations regarding various points of doctrine in dispute between the Romish and
the Reformed Churches.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>19th January 1551</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;As God has called you to give testimony
to his Gospel, never doubt that he will strengthen you
in the might of his Spirit; and that, as he has already begun,
so he must needs perfect his work, manifesting himself victorious
in you against his enemies. It is true that the triumphs
of Jesus Christ are despised by the world; for while we are
under reproach, the wicked are glorifying themselves in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
pride, but yet are they still confounded by the power of that
truth which God has put into our mouth, and our hearts are
also strengthened to obtain the victory over Satan and all his
supporters, while looking for the day when the glory of God
shall be fully revealed, to the confusion of the wicked and of
the unbelieving. All that you have felt and experienced, up to
the present moment, of the abounding goodness of God, ought
to confirm you in the assured hope, that he shall not fail you
in the future; meanwhile, however, pray him that he would
make you understand always better and better what a treasure
there is in that doctrine for which you contend, so that in
comparison thereof you may not esteem even your life to be
precious. Have always, besides, your eyes lifted up on high to
that kind Lord Jesus, who will be your surety, seeing that you
are only persecuted for his name. Think upon that immortal
glory which he has purchased for us, to the end that you may
be able to endure in patience the afflictions wherein you are.
Beseech this kind Lord continually that he would give you
such an issue as he has promised to all who are his own, and
that according as he has thought fit to try your faith, so he
would cause you to experience the strength of his promises.
And that as he is the Father of Light, he would enlighten you
to such a degree, that all the thick fumes which the wicked
raise up before you, may not be able to dim your eyesight, and
that all their quirks and cautions may not be able to darken
your understanding, that you should ever lose sight of the
true Sun of Righteousness, who is the very Son of God.</p>

<p>When you have to reply to arguments, you do well to answer
in all simplicity, speaking according to the measure of
your faith, even as it is written: <em>I have believed, therefore I
shall speak</em>. True it is that all those subtilties which they
conceit themselves to have, are nought else but silly prating;
but rest you content with what God has imparted to you of
the knowledge of himself, so as to bear clear testimony unfeignedly
to the truth. For however they may sneer at it, it
will be as a thunderbolt of confusion to them, when they hear
nothing but what is founded upon God and his word. Besides,
you know who it is that has promised to give a mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and wisdom to his own, which his adversaries shall not be
able to withstand. Ask of him that he may guide you, according
to what he shall know to be good. They will not
cease for all that to hold you convicted of heresy; but it has
been ever thus with all the apostles and prophets, and with
all the martyrs. The clerk of court will only write what
suits his own pleasure, but your confession will not fail to be
recorded before God and his angels, and he will make it profitable
to his own as is best for them.</p>

<p>I shall mention briefly some points upon which they have
endeavoured to trouble you. In order to persuade you that
we are not justified by the grace of God alone, they have
alleged that Zacharias and several others are called <em>just</em>.
Well, you must consider how God has accepted them as such.
If on inquiry you find that it is on account of his own free
grace in pardoning all that might have been charged against
them, and not imputing to them their faults and vices, behold
merit entirely excluded; for in saying that faith alone in
Christ justifies us, we understand, in the first place, that we are
all of us accursed, and that there is nothing in us but sin;
and that we are neither able to think, nor to do any good, except
in so far as God governs us by his Holy Spirit, as members
of the body of his Son. Furthermore, that even when
God vouchsafes us the grace to walk in his fear, we are very
far from discharging ourselves of our duty. Now, it is
written: Whosoever shall not fulfil all whatsoever is commanded,
shall be cursed; and therefore we have no other
refuge but to the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, who cleanses
and washes us in the sacrifice of his death, which is our sanctification.
Thus God also accepts as well-pleasing the good
works which we perform in his strength, although they must
always be tainted with some shortcomings. And so in this
way, whosoever thinks to rest upon his own merits, will find
himself, as it were, suspended in the air, to be driven about of
every wind. In short, those who think to merit anything,
would fain make God their debtor, whereas we must hold
everything of his pure bounty. We shall be rich and abounding
in merits, if in Jesus Christ: while we are strangers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
his grace, we need not think to have one drop of good in us.
If the enemies bring forward the word <em>wages</em>, let it not trouble
you, for God gives wages to his own, although they are in nowise
worthy of them; but inasmuch as he accepts the service
which HE has enabled them to render, having consecrated
them in the blood of his Son Jesus Christ, on purpose that
they may derive all their value from thence. Wherefore, the
wages which God promises to his faithful ones, presupposes
the remission of their sins, and the privilege they have of
being supported as his children. And in truth this word,
<em>justification</em>, implies that God holds us as just, and therefore
loves us, the which we obtain by faith alone: for Jesus Christ
is the sole cause of our salvation. It is true that St. James
takes another signification, when he says, <em>that works help faith
for our justification</em>; for he means to prove by the effect that
we are justified: neither does he dispute at all in regard
to the foundation of our salvation, and wherein our confidence
must be placed; but only how the true faith is known, so that
no one may make mistakes in regard to it, glorifying himself
in the empty name. Should they return to you with further
importunity on this point, I hope God will furnish you wherewithal
to overcome them.</p>

<p>Concerning the intercession of the Virgin Mary and departed
saints, come back always to this principle, that it is
not for us to appoint advocates in paradise, but for God, who
has ordained Jesus Christ a single one for all. Also, that our
prayers ought to be offered up in faith, and therefore ordered
by the word of God, as saith St. Paul in Romans x. Now, it
is certain, that throughout the word of God there is not a
single syllable of what they say; wherefore all their prayers
are profane and displeasing to him. If they further reply to
you, that it is not forbidden to us, the answer is easy: that
it is forbidden to us to set about anything according to our
own proper fancy, yea, in matters of far less moment; but
above all, that prayer is a most high privilege, and too sacred
to be directed according to our fantasy. Nay more, they
cannot deny that their having recourse to the saints arises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
from pure distrust that Jesus Christ alone would be sufficient
for them.</p>

<p>As for their continual reply, that the charity of the saints
is not diminished, the answer is easy: that charity is regulated
and limited by what God requires from each individual.
Now, he desires that the living exercise themselves in prayer
for one another. Of the departed there is no mention made,
and in such important matters we must imagine nothing out
of our own brain, but keep to what is told us in Scripture.</p>

<p>In regard to what the adversaries allege, that it is said in
Genesis that the name of Abraham and Isaac was to be invoked
after their decease, true it is that the text runs thus;
but it is pure absurdity to bring it forward for the present
purpose. That is written in the forty-eighth chapter of Genesis,
where it is said, that Jacob in blessing Ephraim and
Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, prayed to God that the names
of his fathers Abraham and Isaac, and his own, may be called
upon these two lads, as on the heads of the tribes lineally
descended from himself. Now, that is as much as if he had
said, that they were to be reputed and reckoned as being of
the number of the twelve tribes, and that they should form
two heads of tribes, as if they had been his children in the
first degree; as also that they were born in Egypt. He binds
them together by his prayer to the lineage which God had
blessed and sanctified, because at that time they were separate,
according to outward appearance. And so that form of
expression signifies nothing more than the bearing of the
name of Abraham, and being owned as of his lineage, as it is
said in chap. iv. of Isaiah, that the name of the husband is
called upon the wife, inasmuch as the wife is under the shadow
and guidance of her husband.</p>

<p>So far as they bring forward Saint Ignatius, you do not
require much of an answer. There is one passage where he
says: <em>That Jesus Christ stands for him instead of all ancestry</em>.
Arm yourself then with that single word, to bring them back
to the pure doctrine of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Because I have made use of that expression against the
Papists, they take advantage of it to say, that I approve and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
value the book whence it is taken. Now, that you may not
be deceived thereby, I assure you, that it contains such a heap
of silly folly, that the monks of the present day could not
write greater nonsense. But seeing that you are not acquainted
with the Latin tongue, and still less with the Greek
in which Saint Ignatius has written, (if indeed we have anything
which is truly his,) you need not enter upon this question.
Be content to answer them, that you can never go
wrong while following Jesus Christ, who is the Light of the
world. As for the early doctors, those who are better read
in their writings will be able to tell them quite enough to
stop their mouths. Let it be enough for you to possess the
assurance of true faith in the word of Jesus Christ alone,
which can neither fail you, nor deceive. And it is even
thither that all the early doctors send them, protesting that
they have no wish to be believed, excepting in so far as what
they speak shall be found conformable to what is taught us of
God, and which is contained in his word.</p>

<p>On the subject of the Sacrament of the Supper, when they
speak to you about transubstantiation, you have a ready
answer: that all those passages which they bring together,
even if they could be taken in the sense which they adduce,
cannot be applied to the mass. For, when it is said, <em>This is
my body and my blood</em>, it is also then and there added, <em>Take,
eat ye, and drink ye all of this cup</em>. Now, among them, there
is but one who eats the whole; and even at Easter, he gives
but a part of it to the people. But there is even yet a sorer
evil, that instead of what Jesus Christ said,&mdash;<em>Take</em>; they presume
to offer a sacrifice, which was to be unique and of perpetual
efficacy. And, besides, in order to have some help from
these words, they ought to maintain the observance of the
Supper, which they do not. Moreover, you can always protest,
that you do not deny that Jesus Christ gives us his body,
provided that we look for it from heaven. In reply to all the
cavils which they may allege, you have only to declare to
them that which you have seen and heard, well knowing that
it is from God you have it; for our faith would be very
slender indeed, if it were founded only upon men. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
nothing better, then, than continually to meditate the doctrine
wherein lies the true substance of our Christianity, so that in
due time and place, you may be able to manifest that you
have not believed in vain. And as I have said from the
beginning, if the enemies of the truth are stirred by their
ambition to contend, manifest on your part, that it is enough
for you that you glorify God in opposing their tricks and
sophistries. Content yourself with having for your buckler
a simple confession of that which God has imprinted upon
your heart. Least of all need you torment yourself, if they
deal in impudent calumnies against me or others, seeing that
they have leave to speak evil without rhyme or reason. Let
us bear patiently all the reproaches and slanders which they
cast upon us; for we are not better than Saint Paul, who tells
us that we must walk in the midst of false accusing and vituperation.
Provided we do what is right, when they speak
evil concerning us, we may bear it with unconcern. Besides,
when they lay fresh calumnies upon us, we may well render
thanksgiving to God, that we have a clear conscience in his
sight and before men, and that we are free from all suspicion
of evil. And on the other hand, albeit that we are wretched
sinners, so full of wretchedness and poverty, that we groan by
reason of it continually; still he does not permit the wicked
to speak evil of us, unless falsely; yea, to condemn them from
their own mouth, of having invented regarding us that which
they had not very far to search for, inasmuch as it is in themselves.
Let us therefore glory in the grace of God with all
humility, when we see that these poor unhappy men, like
drunkards, glory in their shame. If you are vexed to hear
them speak evil thus deceitfully concerning me, you ought to
be far more deeply grieved to hear them blaspheme against
our Saviour and Master, to whom belongs all honour, since,
making full account of all the innocence which shall ever be
in us, we might well be overwhelmed in utter confusion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, comfort yourself in our Almighty God, who
has vouchsafed us the grace to knit us together so entirely
with his Son, that all the devils of hell, and all the wicked of
the world, can never be able to separate us. Rejoice, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that you uphold his quarrel, with a good conscience,
hoping that he will strengthen you to bear whatsoever it shall
please him you should suffer. We have such remembrance
of you in our prayers, as we ought to have, in beseeching the
God of all grace, that seeing it has pleased him to employ you
in the maintenance of his truth, he would vouchsafe you all
that is needful for the discharge of so honourable a service;
that he would strengthen you in true perseverance; that he
would give you true spiritual truth, so as that you may seek
only the advancement of his name, without regard to self;
and that he would show himself your protector in such wise,
that you may feel it to your own consolation, and that others
also may take knowledge of it for their edification. All the
brethren hereabouts salute you in the Lord, rejoicing greatly
that he has wrought so powerfully in you, having also compassion
on you in your captivity, and desiring that it may
please this gracious God to unfold his goodness and mercy
upon you.</p>

<h3>Various particulars&mdash;literary labours of Theodore Beza.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>24th January 1551</i>.
</p>

<p>I send you a reading of three letters, that I may not be any
longer in your debt. For Toussain commends himself to your
prayers, and Farel is desirous of your advice, so I thought
that you would be interested in the letters of both. I wished
you to know also what answer Haller gave me. I am glad
that he received me with such moderation, because of the
harsh violence with which many attack me. But more of all
this when I shall see you. You cannot believe how much I
am displeased with the present state of our republic. Indeed,
it would be more proper at present to call it an <em>oligarchy</em>.
Accordingly, familiar conversation is not necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
discussion of those matters. Farel had written me before,
that the Synod was to meet on the fifth of March. He seems
to be wishing advice at present regarding a new day [of meeting.]
I have written to him, however, to abide by the day
already agreed upon, if he wishes me to be present.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> John
Laski salutes you all. I perceive now that I have been twice
deceived by Florian. For he had false letters of recommendation,
which he made use of. Excuse me to our friend Beza
for not writing him at present. He may take his own way
with the Apocrypha, but I have forewarned him that there
will be a greater saving, if he undertakes a new version of it.
If he has any of the Psalms done, they need not be waiting
for company.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Request him, therefore, to send some of them,
at least, by the first messenger. I shall write to Vergerio and
the Zurichers by and by. In the meantime, if you can find a
trustworthy messenger, you will attend to the letter to Bernardin.
Adieu, most excellent brother, together with your
wife and family. Kind regards to the brethren. May the

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, (<i>January 1551.</i>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,&mdash;If I must excuse myself towards your Majesty for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
having used the boldness to dedicate these books which I now
present to you, I would need to find an advocate to speak a
word for me. For so far would my letter be from having
credit enough to do that, that it would even stand in need of
a fresh excuse. And, indeed, as I never should have taken
upon me to address the Commentaries to you which I have
published with your name, neither should I have ventured
now to write to you, but for the confidence I had already
conceived, that both would be well received. For inasmuch
as, holding me to be among the number of those who are zealous
for the advancement of the kingdom of the Son of God,
you have not disdained to read what I did not specially present
to your Majesty, I have thought, that if, while serving
Jesus Christ my Master, I could likewise testify to the reverence
and singular affection which I bear you, I could not fail
to find a kind and courteous acceptance.</p>

<p>Moreover, Sire, holding myself assured that my letter will
have such a reception from you as I desire, I shall not hesitate
to pray and beseech you in the name of Him to whom you
ascribe all authority and power, to take courage in following
out what you have so well and happily begun, as well in your
own person as in the state of your kingdom; namely, the consecration
of all to God and to our blessed Saviour, who has so
dearly purchased us. For as regards general reformation, it
is not so well established, as that it should be wise to look on
it as achieved. And, in fact, it would be very difficult to
purge in a day such an abyss of superstition as there is in the
papacy. Its root is too deep, and has expanded itself too
widely, to get so soon to the bottom of it. But whatsoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
difficulties or delays there may be, the excellency of the work
is well worthy of unwearying pursuit.</p>

<p>I have no doubt, Sire, but Satan will put many hindrances
in the way before you to slacken your pace, and to make your
zeal grow cold. Your subjects, for the most part, do not
know the blessing which you procure for them. The great,
who are raised to honour, are sometimes too wise in their own
conceits to make much account of the word, far less to look
to God at all. And new and unexpected conflicts arise daily.
Now I hope, indeed, Sire, that God has stored you with such
greatness and constancy of mind, that you will neither be
weakened nor wearied by all that. But the thing itself is of
so great importance, that it well deserves that one should
apply to it far more than human strength and energy. And
then, after all, when we shall have striven to the very uttermost,
there will always remain more waiting to be done.</p>

<p>We see how, in the time of the good King Josiah, who has
the special testimony of the Holy Spirit, that he approved
himself a prince excellent in faith, in zeal, and in all godliness;
nevertheless, the Prophet Zephaniah shows, that there was still
some remainder of bygone superstitions, yea, even in the city
of Jerusalem. Even so, however you may labour with your
Council, Sire, you will find it very difficult completely to uproot
all the mischief which would well deserve to be corrected.
But this ought to be a great confirmation to animate and spur
you on; and even if you should not accomplish all that could
be desired, it is a very sufficient consolation to you, when you
hear that the pains which this good king took, is a service
pleasing to God, insomuch that the Holy Spirit magnifies the
reformation effected by him, as if nothing more had been desired.
Let me entreat you then, Sire, to reach forward to the
mark which is set before you in the example of this godly
king, that you may have the honour, not only of having overthrown
impieties which are clearly repugnant to the honour
and service of God, but also of having abolished and razed to
the ground, whatsoever served merely to nourish superstition.
For when God would praise as with an open mouth the faithful
princes who have restored and again set up the purity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
his service, he expressly adds this word, that they have also
<em>taken away the high places</em>, that the memory of foolish devotions
might be utterly obliterated.</p>

<p>True it is, Sire, that there are things indifferent which one
may allowably tolerate. But then we must always carefully
insist that simplicity and order be observed in the use of ceremonies,
so that the clear light of the Gospel be not obscured
by them, as if we were still under the shadows of the law;
and then that there may be nothing allowed that is not in
agreement and conformity to the order established by the Son
of God, and that the whole may serve and be suited to the
edification of the Church. For God does not allow his name
to be trifled with,&mdash;mixing up silly frivolities with his holy
and sacred ordinances. Then there are manifest abuses which
cannot be endured, such as prayer for the souls of the departed,
of putting forward to God the intercession of saints
in our prayers, as also of joining them to God in invocation.
I do not doubt, Sire, that you are aware that these are so many
corruptions of true Christianity. I beseech you, in the name
of God, that you may please look to that matter, so that the
whole may be restored to a sound and wholesome state.</p>

<p>There is another point, Sire, of which you ought to take a
special charge, namely, that the poor flocks may not be destitute
of pastors. Ignorance and barbarism have lain so heavy
on this accursed popery, that it is not easy to obtain all at
once men fit and duly qualified to discharge that office. Notwithstanding,
the object is well worth pains, and that your
officers, Sire, should have an eye upon it, as they ought.
Without that, all the good and holy ordinances which you
can make, will scarce avail for the reformation of the heart in
good earnest.</p>

<p>Further, inasmuch as the schools contain the seeds of the
ministry, there is much need to keep them pure and thoroughly
free from all ill weeds. I speak thus, Sire, because in your
universities, it is commonly said, there are many young people
supported on the college bursaries, who, instead of giving
good hope of service in the Church, rather show an inclination
to do mischief, and to ruin it, not even concealing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
they are opposed to the true religion. Wherefore, Sire, I beseech
you anew, in the name of God, that you may please to
take order therein, to the effect, that property which ought to
be held sacred, be not converted to profane uses, and far less
to nourish venomous reptiles, who would desire nought better
than to infect everything for the future. For, in this way, the
Gospel would always be kept back by these schools, which
ought to be the very pillars thereof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sire, all honest hearts praise God, and feel themselves
greatly obliged to you, that it hath pleased you of your
favour to grant churches to your subjects who use the French
and German languages.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In so far as regards the use of the
Sacraments, and spiritual order, I hope that the permission
which you have been pleased to confer upon them will bear
fruit. Howbeit, Sire, I cannot help beseeching you once more,
feeling so deeply how needful it is, not only that you would
secure the rest and contentment of the godly who desire to
serve God and to live peaceably in obedience to you, but also
that you would restrain vagabond and dissolute people, should
such withdraw into your kingdom.</p>

<p>I know well, Sire, that you have people of distinguished
learning at hand, who can make known to you these things
by word of mouth, far better than myself by writing; also,
that in your council you have men of prudence and zeal to
suggest all that is expedient. Among the others, I have no
doubt that Monsieur the Duke of Somerset spares no trouble
to follow out that wherein he has employed himself so faithfully
hitherto. But I believe, Sire, that all that shall be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
hindrance to prevent your kind reception of what you will
recognize as proceeding from a like source.</p>

<p>To conclude, Sire, forasmuch as I fear to have already
wearied you with my tediousness, I pray you, in respect of
that as in everything else, that you would please excuse and
pardon me of your kind favour, to which very humbly I beg
to be commended, having besought our gracious God and Father
to maintain and uphold you in his holy protection, to
guide you by his Spirit, and to cause his name to be more and
more glorified by you.</p>

<h3>He excuses the infrequency of his letters, and urges the publication of the <cite>Consensus</cite>.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>17th February 1551</i>.
</p>

<p>Although you readily excuse the fewness of my letters, and
even, with your usual courtesy, voluntarily relieve me of that
duty, I nevertheless feel ashamed of my exceeding indolence
and negligence, in having been less attentive to you than to
some of my every-day friends. But indeed the reason of this
is, that others, by their violent importunity, shake me free of
my listlessness. You, with a more generous indulgence, allow
me to be silent; and indeed I am so much exhausted by constant
writing, and so greatly broken down by fatigue, that I
frequently feel an almost positive aversion to writing a letter.
Would that others had as much of your moderation as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
enable them to cultivate a sincere friendship at the expense of
less writing. Our French friends oppress me in this way
beyond all consideration. It so happens, that by continually
apologizing, I am getting myself suspected of indolence by my
particular friends. Add to this, that unless I have a definite
subject before me, I seem to act absurdly enough when I drag
in matters known to everybody, as if they were possessed of
novelty. But as to what you say you wrote me about some
time ago, without receiving any answer, I cannot make out
what you refer to, unless, as I conjecture, you had sent me some
communication which did not reach me. If such be the case,
I shall not neglect to look after it, now that you have given me
the hint. As certain individuals of a malignant, morose, and
ill-natured disposition, are making an ado about our union, I
should, if agreeable to you, wish it to be published.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> I have
calmly endured, overlooked, and swallowed many things, but,
believe me, I have failed to observe that it was greatly displeasing
to Satan. If the form of the union is published, I
trust it will be useful to the Churches of Saxony. However,
you will, with your accustomed sagacity, determine upon what
is best. When numbers were asking for copies of it, I would
on no account allow it to be printed, until I should obtain your
permission. I wrote you about the matter on a previous occasion,
but inferred from your silence that you considered it as
yet premature. I should wish, however, that you would give
me your judgment on it. You did me a favour concerning
the Bull. Had I received it two days earlier, it would have
been of more use to me. For I had already entered upon
the composition of the preface, in which that subject is discussed.
I send you a copy of it, if you can find time to read
it. I wish, however, that you would send it to Vergerio,
together with the letter, at your earliest opportunity. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Bull is possessed of one merit, viz., that the Pope breathes
out downright tyranny without any show of deceit. We
must, therefore, as you say, find refuge in prayer. It is said
that Germany will have rest this year from internal war, as
the Turk is annoying Ferdinand. But as it is the Lord who
quiets all tumults of arms, we should pray him to put a
check in all other respects, upon the savage madness of our
enemies.</p>

<p>Adieu, distinguished sir, and specially revered brother.
Salute your family and your colleagues in my name, and in
that of my brethren. May the Lord watch over you, be present
with you, and continue to guide you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>12th March 1551</i>.</p>

<p>I was met by a messenger bearing your letter, when lately
on my way to Neuchatel. After my return home, I received
another from a certain Italian, together with the fifth <cite>Decade</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
You say by way of apology for sending your books, that you
do not do so in order that I may learn from you; for my part,
as I am desirous to make my labours beneficial to all good
men, so on the other hand, I am glad to profit by the writings
of others. And indeed intercourse like this is brotherly,
when we know that the gifts of the Spirit are so distributed
among us, that no one individual is sufficient for himself.
Your gift was, therefore, acceptable to me. The publication
of our agreement was the occasion of very much joy, not only
to myself, but also to Farel and the rest of the brethren.
Would that your letter had reached me fifteen days earlier;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
for it might have been issued during these days of the Frankfort
fair. How seasonable will the publication be for our beloved
France; exceedingly useful too, I hope. I finished
lately my Commentaries on Isaiah and the Canonical Epistles.
I thought proper to dedicate both of them to the King of
England.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> You may have a reading of a copy of one of the
prefaces which I sent to Vergerio. I have added a private
letter also, in which I have endeavoured to kindle the generous
nature of the young man. Meanwhile, we have heard the sad
news of Hooper's imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> I was somewhat apprehensive
of this long ago. I am now afraid that the bishops, as
if victorious, will become much more ferociously insolent.
While, therefore, I admire his firmness in refusing the anointing,
I had rather he had not carried his opposition so far with
respect to the cap and the linen vestment, even although I do
not approve of these: I recently recommended this. He has
many and powerful adversaries, and I doubt not but they will
set themselves violently to crush him. But I trust that the
Lord will be with him, especially because, as I am informed,
some treacherously oppose him, who in other respects pretend
to be favourable to the Gospel. I congratulate you on the
tranquil condition of your Church. There are very vile
wretches here who cause us no small amount of annoyance
and disquiet, who will meet, however, I confidently trust, with
the end which they have merited. The plans of the Emperor
are a source of concern to many. It is justly calculated to
excite suspicion that some of his troops are being transported
across the Alps.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Should he invade this country, my only
comfort is the hope that the Lord will take me away from this
miserable life. He will not, meanwhile, neglect his own flock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
about which I am especially harassed. Adieu, very distinguished
sir, and most esteemed fellow-minister, together with

<h3>Mention of a letter to the Duke of Somerset&mdash;Re-opening of the Council of Trent&mdash;symptoms
of war in Europe.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>10th April 1551</i>.
</p>

<p>I have received two letters from you within these few days,
both full of remarkable good-will towards me, and therefore
very agreeable. It is well that God has not only bestowed on
us the same desire to incite the English King and his advisers
to go on, but has also made our plans so fitly to harmonize.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
This circumstance will surely have some influence in confirming
them. I begin now to look every day for the return of the
messenger who carried thither my books with the accompanying
letter. As soon as he returns, if he report anything worthy
of mention, I shall take care to inform you of it. Meanwhile,
I have written to the very illustrious the Duke of Somerset,
and have shown him that it is impossible but that the Papists
will become more insolent, unless the disagreement regarding
the ceremonies be speedily adjusted.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> I have advised him to
extend a hand to Hooper. Whatever the Pope may pretend,
I do not think that the Council of Trent is being seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
assembled.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The reason for my conjecture is, that the King of
France commanded all his bishops to make a careful survey,
each of his own diocese, and to return completed records of
each visitation to the metropolitan bishops within six months;
and informed them that it was his intention to hold a general
council of the whole kingdom. No mention was made on that
occasion of Trent and the Pope. I have no doubt, however,
but that there was an understanding between them; namely,
that the French King should, to gain the favour of the Pope,
by the pretence of a national council, dissolve that at Trent.
Thoughtful men are of opinion that the flames of war have
been kindled in Italy. The Turkish ambassador is at present
at the French court to stimulate the king to war. An immense
fleet threatens Italy or Spain. The Lord will accordingly so
overrule them, as that they will not be so dangerous to the
Church. It was not kind of you, when you knew that my
course would lie in your direction when on my way to Trent,
not to offer lodgings to at least one of us. You perhaps expect
a new Bull which will admit us.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> We are not, however, of the
number of those who obtain a place, either from right or custom,
or the favour of the Apostolic See. We may accordingly
remain at home. Yet there is something for us to do even at
home. For Christ furnishes material for labour, and Satan
does not permit us to be idle. You will pardon my haste.
For when these young Germans offered me their services, they
gave me only an hour for writing, and it has almost expired.
Adieu, most accomplished sir, and very dear brother, worthy
of my hearty regard. My colleagues respectfully salute you.
They and I present kindest salutations to Bibliander, Pellican,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
and Gualter, and the rest of the brethren. May the Lord preserve
you all by his power, direct you by his Spirit, and bless
your labours. Our agreement was not so carefully expressed in
Latin as I could have wished; but it will soon be printed
again. Meantime, I have added a French translation to the
Latin, in which you will not find any blunders. Yours truly,</p>

<h3>Death of Bucer and of Joachim Vadian.</h3>

</p>

<p>Although you have received no letters from me for a considerable
time, let me tell you, that you have, on that account,
been a source of constant and even anxious thought to me.
The grief which I have suffered at the death of Bucer increases
my anxiety and fear. I have now again experienced a fresh
wound from the death of Vadian, whose labour, although of
wide influence, and calculated to be felt throughout the entire
Church, was nevertheless of especial use in the state, and of
great importance among the Swiss and Grisons in particular.
I feel my heart almost like to break when I think of the
great loss the Church of God has sustained in the death of
Bucer. The Lord grant that I may leave in life all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>

<p>Nicolas<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> has at length returned from England, having been
detained for eleven days by head winds, and afterwards tossed
about by so severe a tempest, that he scarcely escaped shipwreck.
He reports that he was so kindly and affectionately
received, that I have good reason to congratulate myself that
my labour was spent to the best advantage. After having delivered
my letter to the Duke of Somerset, and having said
that he had another also for the King, the Duke himself undertook
the duty of presenting it, and on the following day set
out for the Court. If I am not deceived, the work not only
greatly pleased the Royal Council, but also filled the King
himself with extraordinary delight. The Archbishop of
Canterbury informed me that I could do nothing more useful
than to write to the King more frequently. This gave me
more pleasure than if I had come to the possession of a great
sum of money. In the present state of the kingdom, many
things are still to be desired. Among other evils that are incurable
until the King shall have attained his majority, there
is this one: that all the revenues of the Church are devoured
by the nobles, and they are meanwhile hiring for a miserable pittance,
worthless men to discharge the duties, or at least occupy
the position of pastors. I nevertheless will not cease to goad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the whole of them. I did not allude to the death of Bucer,
lest I should open my own wound afresh.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> For when I reflect
how great a loss the Church of God has sustained in the death
of this one man, I cannot but feel the deepest anguish. He
would have been of great advantage to England. I was expecting
more from his future writings, than anything he had
hitherto performed. In addition to this, the Church is now
destitute of faithful teachers. Vadian had very great influence
among the Swiss.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The Lord has taken him away. Osiander
is absolutely mad.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Let us take courage, however, until we
shall have finished our course and reached the goal. One thing
I fear, that while holding a place among the runners, I may set
an example of slowness. Yet I am not a little comforted by
this, that you, who have outstripped all others, extend to me
so much pardon and mild indulgence. It is sufficient, if, not
led away by the unsettled wanderings of others, we hold on in
the right way; even although some get far ahead of us, and
others lag a great way behind. As for our old friend with the
new face,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> I shall for my part be careful to encourage him, as
you urgently advise, and shall give my colleagues a hint to do
the same. But believe me, he manifests no sincerity. I surmised
from the first what he was wishing to be at. I concealed
that I had detected it; kept my hand on it, as it were. He
patronizes, as he used to do, persons given over to shameless
pleasures. He is in like manner given to defend bad causes.
His arrogance and ferocity are in no degree abated. His cohort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
runs riot more at will than ever. However, I shall so conduct
myself, that he will easily perceive that I am heartily reconciled
to him. You have heard, I suppose, what a mournful procession
they lately made: and yet so shameful a butchering of a
most distinguished citizen has not restrained their wantonness.
As to Christopher's asking me to attend their suppers, I have,
hitherto, indeed, refused none of them: but when the duties were
intrusted to Ambard Corné, he, by his procrastination, broke
in upon the established order. I am, in the meantime, much
occupied with foreigners, who daily pass through this place in
great numbers, or who have come hither to take up their abode.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
Among others, the Marquis de Vico, a Neapolitan, arrived
lately. Another will follow by and by. Should you pay us
a visit next autumn, you will find our city considerably increased&mdash;a
pleasing spectacle to me, if they do not overwhelm
me with their visits. Viret was here lately, but he went off
sooner than I could have wished. There is already open war
between the Pontiff and the French.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> There is a rumour, that
all the Cardinals who sided with the King, have fled from Rome.
If the Emperor is to be involved in this war, he will be forced
to give some relief to Magdeburg, and those places allied with
it. Adieu, most upright brother; salute my friends earnestly,
both your colleague and the other fellow-ministers. Ours also
send kindest regards to you, viz., my colleagues, Normandie,
Budé, Trier, Saint Laurent, the two Colladons, and my brother.
May the Lord long spare you to us; may he shine on you
with his Spirit, bless your holy endeavours, and watch over
the Church committed to your care!&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Sickness of Theodore Beza&mdash;Calvin's grief.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>30th June 1551.</i>
</p>

<p>When the messenger presented himself with your letter to
Beza, I was seized with fresh alarm, and, at the same time,
weighed down with a load of grief. For I was informed, the
day before, that he had been seized with the plague. I was
therefore not only troubled about the danger he was in, but
from my very great affection for him I felt almost overpowered,
as if I was already lamenting his death; although, indeed, this
grief did not rise so much from private regard, as from my
public anxiety for the prosperity of the Church. Indeed, I
were destitute of human feeling, did I not return the affection
of one who loves me with more than a brother's love, and
reveres me like a very father. But the Church's loss afflicted
me more deeply, when I pictured a man, of whom I had so
very high expectations, suddenly snatched away from us by
death, at the very outset of his career&mdash;a man whose gentle
disposition, polished manners, and native candour, had endeared
him to all good men. Should you ever happen to make
a secret and hasty journey hither&mdash;which I am very anxious
you should&mdash;you will find him far superior in those respects
to anything I have stated. I trust that melancholy foreboding
is far distant, of an event which you say would be an irreparable
loss to you. Your coming would be the more desirable,
as he was very anxious to see you when he left. What
should we delight in but Christ? Yet I confidently trust that
the life of the man will not be denied to our prayers. For although
he has not yet escaped danger, yet yesterday's messenger
brought us more hopeful accounts of him. To-morrow I

<h3>Protestations of attachment&mdash;reforms required in the Church of England&mdash;squandering
of the revenues of benefices and of the universities.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 25th July 1551</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;I know not how to thank you enough for
the kind reception which my messenger has met with from
you, not merely in that you have been pleased to take the
trouble of offering my books to the King, but for all other
proofs of the singular friendly affection which you have hitherto
graciously shown me. As for the youth whom you have
taken into your service, I should not have had the boldness to
write to you about him, had I not thought, as was generally
expected, that he was likely to turn out remarkably well. But
so much the more am I obliged to you, since I find that my
recommendation has been of use in this quarter. As however
all that I could write would be but very feeble compared
with what is in my heart, and what your benefits deserve, I
prefer to desist from further comment on them. Only I pray
you, Monseigneur, to consider me so wholly yours, that had I
any way of doing you service, it would not be my fault if you
lacked proof of more good-will than I know how to express.
I would have made these excuses to you sooner, or rather
these thanks, if it may please you to hold them such, had it
not been for the desire which this gentleman had, himself to
present my letter to you. And in this also, I can perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the friendship you are pleased to show towards me, since
those who well deserve to have access to you, hope to be the
more welcome by means of my letters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Monseigneur, I shall not cease to commend to
your attention that which is of itself dear and precious enough
to you. It is, that you provide and take heed that God may
be faithfully honoured and served; above all, that better order
be established in the Church than heretofore. Albeit it may
not be easy to obtain people specially qualified to discharge
this office; yet, from what I hear, there are two great hindrances
against which it would be essential to provide. The
first is, that the revenues of the universities which have been
founded for the maintenance of scholars, are ill distributed;
many being thus supported who openly profess to resist the
Gospel, so far are they from affording any hopes of upholding
that which has been there built up with great pains and
labour.</p>

<p>The second evil is, that the revenue of the cures is diverted
and wasted, so that there is not wherewithal to support worthy
men who might be fit to discharge the office of true pastors.
And thus ignorant priests are installed, who bring in great confusion.
For the character of individuals begets a great contempt
of the word of God; and thus whatever their authority,
they cannot exercise it. I pray you, therefore, Monseigneur,
to advance and improve the Reformation, and so give it permanence;
be pleased to exert all your might in correcting this
abuse. I quite believe that it has not been your fault that
matters have not been better regulated in the first instance.
But since it is very difficult all at once to organize an establishment
as well as might be desirable, it only remains that we
persevere, so as to perfect in time what has been well begun.</p>

<p>It ought not to be ill taken by those who at the present
time derive profit from Church property, that the pastors be
adequately supported; seeing that every one ought to strive
to support them out of his own private means, were there no
public ones. It would even be to their own advantage to discharge
themselves of this debt, for they cannot expect to prosper
while defrauding the people of God of their spiritual pasturage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by depriving the churches of good pastors. And on your part,
Monseigneur, I have no doubt, when you have faithfully
laboured to reduce these matters to order, that God will the
more multiply his blessings upon you. But since I feel
assured that you are so well inclined of yourself that I need
not longer to exhort, I shall conclude, after having besought
our good Lord, that it may please him to guide you always
by his Spirit, to increase you in all well-doing, and to cause
his name to be more and more glorified by you. Even so,
Monseigneur, I do commend me very humbly to your gracious
favour.</p>

<p>I regret the postponement of the Council, now when it is too
late. Send for me, however, when you think fit; although it
will be much more convenient, in another respect, for you to
come to us. I send you the ravings of George of Sicily, which
the Italian brethren wish me to refute.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> I have declined, however,
as there would be no end to replies if every single dog of
that sort were to be silenced by a special treatise. It is better,
therefore, that many do not deem it worthy of a reply. If I
ever find leisure, I should prefer executing what I undertook
years ago. By replying to Pighius, I shall put a stop to the
barking of others. I have nothing to say regarding Matthaeus
at present, except that, if while presenting the brethren with
his work, he at the same time warn them of its dangers, I hope
they will find it agreeable. We can discuss the rest better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
when we meet. Adieu, most worthy and upright brother.
Salute your wife and little daughters, also your colleague,
Ribet, and the rest of the brethren. You may tell Hotman,
that I gave a willing audience of two or three hours to a fellow-citizen
of his, but I fear I was not of much service to him.
He is too much puffed up with stolid self-assurance, for anything
to make an impression on him.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Edict of Chateaubriand, in France&mdash;attacks on Calvin in Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>15th October 1551</i>.
</p>

<p>My slowness in writing to you is owing to the want of messengers.
For I do not care for sending a letter which may
have lost its interest by being so long in reaching you. When
Beza undertook to see my letter delivered to you without delay,
I was unwilling to neglect a duty in which I must confess I
am too remiss. I do not know how matters are moving in
England. The matrimonial alliance with France does not, in
my opinion, forebode so much good as many seem to think.
Would, at least, that it might mitigate somewhat the fury of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
his father-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> For in order to gain new modes of venting
his rage against the people of God, he has been issuing atrocious
edicts, by which the general prosperity of the kingdom is
broken up. A right of appeal to the supreme courts has
hitherto been, and still is, granted to persons guilty of poisoning,
of forgery, and of robbery; yet this is denied to Christians:
they are condemned by the ordinary judges to be dragged
straight to the flames, without any liberty of appeal. It has
been decreed, that the friends of those whose lives are at stake
must not dare to intercede for them, unless they wish to be
charged with patronizing heresy. The better to fan the flames,
all informers are to receive the third part of the goods of the
accused. Should any judge appear too remiss, he is liable to a
penalty. The King's chancellor is to guard against admitting
such to public offices, or any who may have, on any occasion,
been open to the slightest suspicion. No one, besides, can
hereafter occupy the place of a judge, unless he be hostile to
Christ; and whosoever would aspire to a public office, must
furnish abundant evidence of being obsequious sons of the
Church of Rome; and should any one [gain office] by deception,
a penalty attaches to those who recommended him. A
penalty is imposed, besides, on all citizens who may, by their
suffrages, have raised to the magistracy, any individual known
to hold, or suspected of holding, the Lutheran doctrines. The
Supreme Council is bound by law to compel any of their number,
who may seem to have a leaning to our doctrines, to clear
himself by oath. All are commanded, with more than usual
earnestness, to adore the breaden god on bended knee. All
parsons of parishes are commanded to read the Sorbonne
articles every Sabbath for the benefit of the people, that a
solemn abnegation of Christ may thus resound throughout the
land. The goods of all who have migrated to us are to be confiscated,
even although they should be sold, or in any way disposed
of, previous to their departure, unless the authorities have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
been duly apprised of the sale before their departure was contemplated.
Geneva is alluded to more than ten times in the
edict, and always with a striking mark of reproach. But indeed
every place of dissent from the See of Rome is referred to.
This ferocity is necessary, in order that the direst confusion
may follow. The flames are already kindled everywhere, and
all highways are guarded lest any should seek an asylum here.
If any opportunity occurs, we must spare no pains to alleviate
the sufferings of our brethren. I would already have been on
my way to you, for the purpose of holding a consultation, had
I not been excluded access to you, at present, by your entreaties.
Nevertheless, I beseech you, in the name of Christ,
that you keep an attentive lookout in all directions; but I do
not see what assistance is to be expected from those who sit
down so securely amid their own dangers. How ominous!
The sword is whetted for our throats, and we, who are all
brethren, seek to avoid a consultation! With these warnings,
it becomes us to accustom ourselves to fix our regards on
heaven. How I fear we may, by and by, suffer a heavier punishment
for this our inactivity than could be wished! In
truth, I am not astonished that they are so slow in checking
the insult of the enemy, when they take worthless villains to
their bosom, by whom the Church is torn and wounded, and
exposed to the ridicule of her enemies. A certain Dominican,
a minister of the word in a neighbouring village, has emerged
from the mud under evil auspices.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> He bawled out openly in
the assembly that he had a dispute with me and the Church of
Geneva; and this without the least provocation. Not content
with that, he brought forward a paper filled with foul accusations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
in which I was bitterly reviled for more than twenty
times. On the matter being known, he was sent home. Emboldened
by impunity, any satellite of the Council of Trent
insults me now with equal ferocity. This is the communion
of the Church which we daily profess. I omit other matters
equally dishonourable, which I endure, not without sadness;
although I am not so much moved on my own account, as on
that of the public; for I see clearly that such a breaking up
of all orderly discipline, so foreign to Christianity, cannot
stand for any length of time.</p>

<p>Adieu, very excellent and highly revered brother. May the
Lord guide you ever; may his blessing rest on your pious
endeavours, and may he shield you by his protection!</p>

<p>Salute Theodore, Pellican, Gualter, and the rest of the brethren
earnestly in my name.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Statement of the controversy with Bolsec regarding Election.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, [<i>October 1551</i>.]
</p>

<p>There is one Jerome here, who, having thrown off the monk's
cowl, is become one of those strolling physicians, who, by habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
deception and trickery, acquire a degree of impudence
which makes them prompt and ready in venturing upon anything
whatever. He made an attempt, eight months ago, in a
public assembly of our church, to overthrow the doctrine of
God's free election, which, as received from the word of God, we
teach in common with you. Then, indeed, the impertinence of
the man was regulated by some degree of moderation. He
ceased not afterwards to make a noise in all places, with the
intention of shaking the faith of the simple in this all-important
doctrine. At length he openly disgorged what poison was in
him. For when one of our brethren, not long since, was expounding,
after our ordinary custom, that passage in John where
Christ declares that those who do not hear God's words are not
of God; he remarked that as many as have not been born again
of the Spirit of God, continue in a state of stubborn resistance
to God, even to the end, inasmuch as the gift of obedience is peculiar
to the elect of God, on whom it is bestowed. That worthless
wretch rose up, and affirmed that the false and impious
opinion, that the will of God is the cause of all things, took
its rise during the present century from Laurentius Valla; but
that in this he acted wrongly, for he charged God with the
blame of all evils, and falsely imputed to him a tyrannical
caprice, such as the ancient poets fancifully ascribed to their
Jove. He then took up the second head, and affirmed that
men are not saved because they have been elected, but that
they are elected because they believe; that no one is condemned
at the mere pleasure of God; that those only are condemned
who deprive themselves of the election common to all. In dealing
with this question, he inveighed against us with a great
deal of violent abuse. The chief magistrate of the city, on
hearing of the matter, imprisoned him, especially as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
been tumultuously haranguing the common people not go allow
themselves to be deceived by us. On being brought before
the Senate for trial, he proceeded to defend his error with no
less obstinacy than audacity. He, moreover, made it his boast
that a considerable number of the ministers of the other
churches sided with him; on which we requested the Senate
not to give its final decision until, having heard from your
church, it should ascertain how this worthless wretch had
wickedly abused your name by making you sanction his error.
Overcome by shame, he at first did not decline the decisions
of the churches, but began to jest about having good reason to
mistrust you from your familiar intimacy with our brother
Calvin. The Senate, however, according to our request, resolved
upon consulting you. Besides, and in addition to this,
he was implicating your church. For while denouncing
Zwingle above all others, he said that Bullinger was of precisely
the same opinion with himself. He has craftily watched
for a handle of discord among the Bernese ministers. We are
really anxious to have this plague so removed from our church,
that it may not infect our neighbours when we have got rid
of it ourselves. Although it is of very great importance to
us and to the public tranquillity, that the doctrine which we
profess should meet with your approval; yet we have no reason
to entreat your confidence in many words. The <cite>Institutes</cite> of
our brother Calvin, against which he is especially directing
his attacks, is not unknown among you. With what reverence
and sobriety he has therein discussed the secret judgments of
God, it is not for us to record: the book is its own bright
witness. Nor in truth do we teach anything here but what is
contained in God's holy word, and what has been held by your
church ever since the light of the Gospel was restored. That
we are justified by faith, we all agree; but the real mercy of
God can only be perceived when we learn that faith is the
fruit of free adoption, and that, in point of fact, adoption flows
from the eternal election of God. But not only does this impostor
fancy that election depends upon faith, but that faith
itself is originated as much by man himself as by divine inspiration.
There can be no doubt, on the other hand, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
when men perish, it must be imputed to their own wickedness.
But by the case of the reprobate whom God, from his own
mysterious counsel, passes by and neglects as if unworthy, we
are taught a striking lesson of humility. Yet such is this
Jerome, that he will not admit that God does anything justly
unless he has palpable evidence of it. In fine, this much is
fixed and conceded by us all, that when man sins, God must
not be regarded as having any share in the blame, nor that the
word sin can in any sense be applied to him. Yet this does
not hinder him from exercising his power, in a wonderful and
incomprehensible way, through Satan and the wicked, as if
they were the instruments of his wrath, to teach the faithful
patience, or to inflict merited punishment on his enemies. This
profane trifler cries out that we bring an impeachment against
God when we allege that he governs all things by his providence;
destroying, in short, in this way, all distinction between
causes as remote and concealed, on the one hand, and as near
and patent on the other; rendering it impossible to regard the
sufferings to which holy Job was subjected as the work of God,
but that he may be held as equally guilty with the Devil, the
Chaldeans, and the Sabæan robbers. Our mutual relationship,
therefore, demands that you will not consider it troublesome to
uphold and maintain, by your countenance, that doctrine of
Christ which has been outraged by the profanity of a wanton
and ill-disposed man. As we confidently trust that you will
do this gladly and of your own accord, we consider it useless
to ply you with anxious and earnest requests; and, on the
other hand, should our services be at any time of advantage
to you, you will ever find us prepared to discharge every
brotherly duty.&mdash;Adieu, most beloved and esteemed brethren.
May God guide you by his Spirit, bless your labours, and defend
your Church!</p>

<p>I am compelled to dictate these few lines, being confined to
bed with a severe headache. The person who is to deliver my
letter to you is my brother's father-in-law. He will, therefore,
communicate to me faithfully anything with which you may

there will be neither difficulty nor delay, yet, as you have especially

<p>There is another thing, also, which I am exceedingly anxious
to obtain from you and the rest of the brethren; but as there
is no need for pressing you on the matter, it will be sufficient
for me to give you a hint of it. Edicts worse than atrocious
have lately been published by the King of France, in which all
manner of cruelties are employed for the extinction of whatever
spark of manliness there is in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Not only has he
increased the rage of those judges and officers who previously,

threats to shed, like very gladiators, the blood of the innocent.
The flames have been kindled already in very many places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
There is one mode, perhaps, by which his fury may be somewhat
appeased: Were those of the Swiss who profess the sound

those commotions of war, their authority might carry the more
weight. As the cause is a just one, and worthy also of your

<p>I shall attend to your orders. Would that we could obtain

found by experience how little advice they can give us. Myconius
approaches the matter with a certain coldness. There is
no use, as you say, in his taking credit to himself for wisdom
from his hesitancy. Yet Sulzer writes just as if it would be
satisfactory. The Senate had sent their own messenger a short
time before. I fear they will repeat the same old song. But
if the men of Berne and Zurich go prudently about the matter,
we need not take it to heart; for all depends on this, lest he
may have been admitted to the Bernese district. I am so much

<h3>Recommendation of a schoolmaster&mdash;complaints against the ministers of Zurich.</h3>


<p class="sig">

</p>

<p>There is little need for my commending the bearer to you,
as he is, in my judgment, sufficiently known and approved by
you. It is no ordinary proof of his piety and modesty when I
state, that not only did he come down to this quarter willingly,
but came forward even with eagerness, when I was almost
prevented, through bashfulness, from asking him to undertake
the matter. Nor have I any doubt but that he will discharge
any duty imposed upon him, faithfully and with care. But
the fact of his being regarded, by competent judges, as a
learned and skilful physician, will perhaps go farther with
your men. Were he not known among you, I should give
ampler testimony in his favour. I only trust that your school
may furnish him with pupils worthy of his position as a
moderately learned master.</p>

<p>I complained lately of the theologians of Bâle,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> who, as compared

I can hardly express to you, my dear Farel, how much I am
annoyed by their rudeness. There is less humanity among us
than among wild beasts. What would happen if we were not
surrounded with enemies? What marvellous dulness is it,
that when three or four churches are driven together into a
corner, they do not recognize each other! In truth, this is
worse than dishonourable, because groundless rumours are circulated,
by which any brother who may be within the bounds
is hindered from showing us any sympathy. The Senate did
not consider the pastors worthy of being written to, but to
heighten the insult, they limited their communication to the
magistrates. Should you be displeased with the general letter
of the men of Zurich, let me tell you, that Bullinger's private
letter to me was not a whit better, although it is preferable
that you should read it and judge for yourself. It is not fair
that I should be troubled with his trifles, while he is, at the
same time, looking down on our wants with supreme contempt.
You will pardon me, therefore, if you do not obtain
what you asked regarding the translation of his book. Adieu,
very dear brother. May the Lord Jesus guide you, and watch
over you continually, together with your brethren and the
church! Salute Christopher and the rest in my name. Michael
will remain here till the end of the week.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<h3>Refusal to reply to the curious questions proposed to him by Socin.</h3>

</p>

<p>You are deceived in so far as you entertain the impression
that Melanchthon does not agree with us on the doctrine of
predestination. I only said briefly that I had a letter written
by his own hand, in which he confessed that his opinion
agreed with mine. But I can believe all you say, as it is
nothing new for him to elude in this matter, the better to
rid himself of troublesome inquiries. Certainly no one can be
more averse to paradox than I am, and in subtleties I find no
delight at all. Yet nothing shall ever hinder me from openly
avowing what I have learned from the word of God; for
nothing but what is useful is taught in the school of this
master. It is my only guide, and to acquiesce in its plain
doctrines shall be my constant rule of wisdom. Would that
you also, my dear Lelio, would learn to regulate your powers
with the same moderation! You have no reason to expect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
reply from me so long as you bring forward those monstrous
questions. If you are gratified by floating among those aërial
speculations, permit me, I beseech you, an humble disciple of
Christ, to meditate on those things which tend towards the
building up of my faith. And indeed I shall hereafter follow
out my wishes in silence, that you may not be troubled by me.
And in truth, I am very greatly grieved that the fine talents
with which God has endowed you, should be occupied not only
with what is vain and fruitless, but that they should also be
injured by pernicious figments. What I warned you of long
ago, I must again seriously repeat, that unless you correct in
time this itching after investigation, it is to be feared you will
bring upon yourself severe suffering. I should be cruel towards
you did I treat with a show of indulgence what I believe to be
a very dangerous error. I should prefer, accordingly, offending
you a little at present by my severity, rather than allow you to
indulge unchecked in the fascinating allurements of curiosity.
The time will come, I hope, when you will rejoice in having
been so violently admonished. Adieu, brother very highly
esteemed by me; and if this rebuke is harsher than it ought
to be, ascribe it to my love to you.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<h3>Thanks for the zeal manifested on behalf of the faithful in France&mdash;Complaints of
the conduct of the Ministers of Zurich in the affair of Bolsec.</h3>


<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>January 1552</i>.</p>

<p>You have clearly shown yourself to be what you have always
been, by your unremitting endeavours to mitigate the rage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
our Pharaoh, and aid our unfortunate brethren. I cannot
forget how strenuously and faithfully you have always devoted
yourself to this cause. Still, I have good reason to fear that
little has been gained by our letters: for the courtiers to
frustrate them is nothing wonderful. Indeed, I lately learned
as much, in a quiet way, from the royal ambassador when he
was here. We would require to send some one, therefore, if
we wish to be of any use. The matter was taken up at Baden,
I understand, but their deliberations probably came to naught.
So confident am I of your watchful attention and faithfulness,
that I consider it unnecessary for me to stimulate you by a
single word.</p>

<p>Would that we were so well satisfied about another matter,
that we could tender our thanks to you and your colleagues
without any qualification. Inasmuch as we experienced&mdash;not
without severe pain&mdash;considerably less support from you than
we had anticipated, I prefer bringing my complaint candidly
before you, rather than nourish my displeasure by keeping it
to myself. You write that you were astonished why we,
annoyed by a vile and impious wretch, should ask your opinion
of a doctrine which he was falsely attacking. In this impression
you have been greatly mistaken, for when he accused us
of holding impious doctrine, we deferred to your judgment out
of respect to you. I fail to see why this should annoy you. I
certainly did not think you would consider any amount of
labour burdensome, which should bring so very great relief to
your brethren. You say that it is a serious matter to give an
unqualified approval of disputations, especially when they turn
upon a matter which, in the reader's judgment, might be
handled to better purpose in some other way. And yet, I have
never supposed, nor do I yet believe, that you belong to the
number of those who are so well pleased with their own performances,
that they cannot peruse without aversion anything
executed by another; nor, in truth, did I propose dictating a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
formula to you, to which we desired your unqualified assent.
It was enough, and more than enough, to have your approval
of a doctrine which we held to be found in the word of God,
nor was it our object to discuss it with skill and acuteness; so
far from that, the matter, when stripped of all artifice, shows
that we wanted nothing more than that by refuting the man's
wicked calumnies, you should bear testimony to our teaching
only what was drawn from the pure fountain of God.</p>

<p>You ought not to have feared, I think, that any one was accusing
you of dishonesty, because I asked you not to think it
troublesome, to give an answer to our magistrates, as if on an
entirely new subject. For how could they make a public statement
regarding a matter, into which no one had made any
inquiry, although I readily allow it appeared differently to
you? Your charging us with the want of moderation and
humanity, was caused, we think, by your placing less confidence
in our letter than you ought to have done. Would that Jerome
were a better man than our letter declared him to be! Would
that he attributed all to the grace of God, as you seem to think.
But for you to plead in defence of a man who seditiously disturbed
a peaceful Church, who strove to divide us by deadly
discord, who, without ever having received the slightest provocation,
loaded us with all sorts of abuse, who publicly taunted
us with representing God as a tyrannical governor, nay more,
that we had put the Jove of the poets in the place of God,&mdash;to
defend such a man, I say, were the extreme of absurdity. How,
moreover, can he attribute all to the grace of God, when he
says that grace is offered alike to all, but that its efficacy rests
with the free will of every one; when he prates about the heart
of flesh, or the susceptibility of grace, being given to all, but so
that every one may receive it of his own accord? Altogether,
I feel grieved beyond measure that there is not a better understanding
between us. Indeed I was astounded, on finding
from your letter, that the kind of teaching which I employ is
displeasing to many good men, just as Jerome is offended by
that of Zuingle. Wherein, I beseech you, lies the similarity?
For Zuingle's book, to speak confidentially, is crammed with
such knotty paradoxes, as to be very different, indeed, in point
of moderation, from what I hold. You are wrong in inferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
that I have promised a new work, in which I undertake to demonstrate
that God is not the author of sin. When that impostor
was vexing me with his calumnies, I stated in refutation
what was true, viz., that I had given sufficient evidence in a
book which I had published, of my utter abhorrence of such
blasphemy. I refer to the book published long since against
<cite>Libertines</cite>. The dishonesty of that worthless wretch, however,
induced me to publish in addition what remained of my reply
to Pighius on <cite>Predestination</cite>. Should I fall into any mistakes,
you will be kind enough to set me right. For the rest, I am
sufficiently alive to the desirableness of my saying what I have
to say with frankness and candour. Jerome has been publicly
sentenced to perpetual exile. Certain slanderers have been
falsely circulating that we desired a more cruel punishment,
and some have been foolish enough to believe it. Our friend,
De Falais, whose maid-servant Jerome had cured of cancer, on
that account espoused his cause so very warmly, that he seemed
almost infatuated. We easily, and from the first, shook ourselves
free of this annoyance. But at the request of the neighbouring
brethren, we were anxious to remove that plague from
the Bernese district. Now that your answer has been ambiguous,
the sorry wretch is making his boast that you countenance
his error. I only wish I could at present venture to indicate
the catastrophe of the tragedy, regarding which you desired to
be informed. You will hear, before long, or I am much mistaken,
in certain attempts just made, that he has paved the
way for making still greater disturbances. Now, if I have laid
bare my inmost feelings in making these complaints to you, let
that have no weight so far as our reply is concerned. Although
you disappointed my expectations, I nevertheless gladly offer
you our friendship. I pass by the others just as if I was entirely
satisfied. In conclusion, as my brother's sister is anxious
about her son who is boarded in your place, I am compelled to
trouble you about him. I wish you would inquire at his teacher,
in her name, as to what progress he is making, and if you find
that he is not realizing the hopes and desires of his father, that
you will inform me of it at your earliest opportunity.</p>

<h2>CCXCI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Farel.</span></h2>

<h3>Fresh complaints by Calvin against the ministers of Zurich and Berne&mdash;his unpopularity
in the latter city&mdash;advices to Farel.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>27th January 1552</i>.
</p>

<p>I received your letter lately, in which you asked me silently
to repress the feeling of wrong done me by your neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
As for the people of Zurich, the die has been cast three days
ago. The remedy was in my hands, indeed, until then. But I
have no inclination to recall those letters which I have lately
despatched. It was absolutely necessary for me afterwards to
write to the theologians of Bâle, with whose answer, apparently
so cold and empty, I had good grounds from the first to be
displeased. But those things advanced by the others were so
very worthless, that they did not cause me much annoyance.
You are much mistaken in thinking that the former party are
about to see their error. Wait rather till they make an absolute
renunciation of the election of God. We have experienced
the wonderful providence of God in this matter; for
without being at the time aware of it, I, by the formula of our
agreement, have so bound them, that they are no longer at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
liberty to do damage to the cause. For, in other circumstances,
as I am informed by one, they would have become the patrons
of Jerome. Even Bibliander, carried away by a sudden fit of
excitement, was within a very little of coming to oppose us.
He is at present engaged in writing something or other. However,
you will find nothing in my letter, if I am not mistaken,
except what is exceedingly temperate. I had, in truth, enough
to do in repressing the grief with which I was at that time
consumed. You will hear from Christopher what Viret advises
to be done with the third. As he has an absolute horror of
going to Berne, I have no special counsel to offer. However,
the atrocity of the evils by which we are beset, compels us to
attempt something. And now new matter for a tragedy has
arisen out of mere nothing. For the chief magistrate of Ternier,
on false and reckless information, eagerly summoned, as
he is accustomed to do, John de Saint André before a public
tribunal, charging him with having said before a public
assembly, that whoever received the Supper on Christmas-day,
received the devil and not Christ.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> And witnesses were found
to give evidence against him. In short, Satan will not lay
aside such fanners as these until he has kindled some dreadful
conflagration. But I suppose we may rather weep over evils of
this sort, than hope to prevent them. At least I do not see
what can be done. If I go to Berne, I fear I shall not receive
a brotherly welcome from the brethren. Wicked men, who are
at present exhibiting so much effrontery, while matters are in a
doubtful state, will then be certain to be more insolent in their
boasting. And although the pastors hold out some show of
friendship, yet I scarcely expect to succeed in inducing them to
maintain friendly intercourse with us, except by the permission
of the Senate. You know how defective they are in courage
and firmness. If they so far comply with our wishes in this
matter, they will nevertheless think that they have doubly discharged
their duty, when they have indicated in a single word
that they have nothing to complain of. There is much talk in
the city in the meantime. While revolving these dangers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
my own mind, I can scarcely venture to seek a remedy for
evils which vex me all the more from my very desire for their
removal. If you hope to find Blaurer of any use to you, you
should employ him. But I abstain from writing, lest some
might think themselves wronged by my complaining to him.
Try him, therefore, and give him advice about what he should
do.</p>

<p>In the next place, I have something about which I wish to
admonish yourself. For I understand the prolixity of your
discourses has furnished ground of complaint to many.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> You
have frequently confessed to us that you were aware of this
defect, and that you were endeavouring to correct it. But if
private grumblings are disregarded because they do not in the
meanwhile give trouble, they may, nevertheless, one day break
forth into seditious clamours. I beg and beseech of you to
strive to restrain yourself, that you may not afford Satan an
opportunity, which we see he is so earnestly desiring. You
know that while we are not called upon to show too much indulgence
to the foolish, we are nevertheless bound to give them
something to allure them. And you are well enough aware
that you have to do with the morose and the choleric; and in
truth their aversion arises simply from too much pride on their
part. Yet, since the Lord commands us to ascend the pulpit,
not for our own edification, but for that of the people, you
should so regulate the matter of your teaching, that the word
may not be brought into contempt by your tediousness. It
is more appropriate, also, for us to lengthen our prayers in
private, than when we offer them in the name of the whole
Church. You are mistaken if you expect from all an ardour
equal to your own.</p>

<p>I have dictated this letter in bed.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Adieu, most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>

<h3>Rigorous and inflexible spirit of Calvin against heresy&mdash;Praise of Theodore Beza.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>January 1552</i>.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;I am very sorry that the praiseworthy act which
you did about half a year ago, has met with no better return.
This is because no good and true servant of God found himself
within reach of such help, as that received by as wicked and unhappy
a creature as the world contains. Knowing partly the
man he was, I could have wished that he were rotting in some
ditch; and his arrival gave me as much pleasure as the piercing
my heart with a poniard would have done. But never could I
have deemed him to be such a monster of all impiety and contempt
of God, as he has proved himself in this. And I assure
you, Madame, that had he not so soon escaped, I should, by way
of discharging my duty, have done my best to bring him to the
stake.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Nevertheless, if the good we purpose does not come to
pass, it is quite enough that God accepts our service. He commands
us to help all those who need, and above all, those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
suffer for his name. If men are often found unworthy of our
help, let us be content that the Master acknowledges it all as
done to himself; and that even if men prove ungrateful, he
will confer so ample a reward, of which we cannot be deprived.
And in this we enjoy a great advantage over those who, in
serving their own fancies, persuade themselves that they do God
service. For when we follow that which he approves, we are in
no danger of losing our labour. Wherefore, let us not weary
in well-doing, as likewise St. Paul exhorts us, signifying that we
should not fail to find much in men that would immediately
discourage us, did we not look beyond them. And, indeed,
there is no doubt that our Lord wishes to try our constancy
when he allows such temptations to befall us. Accordingly,
he who would shield himself behind the ingratitude of mankind,
will not be excused. As regards ourselves, there is much
need that we should be confirmed against such scandals, for we
meet them every day. And I have no doubt, that our Lord
has so confirmed you, that you will not cease exerting yourself
for his people when the opportunity occurs, and you have the
means of doing what your duty requires. For seeing that God
accepts and puts down to his account whatever is done to his
people, it is to him that we fall short, and not to men, when
we do not fulfil this duty. Now, our Lord presents you by
us with an occasion of showing your perseverance, albeit that
it is enough for me to have exhorted you in general.</p>

<p>With regard to the present matter, I prefer to entreat you, as
I now entreat with all possible affection. It is on the behalf of
Monsieur de Bèze,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> against whom a certain Monsieur de Sunistan
has a lawsuit for the priory of Londjumeau. Upon his retirement,
his condemnation was inevitable, for you are aware how
things go in our favour. Be that as it may, Monsieur de Sunistan
would have been well content with much less, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
obtained more than he could have ventured to wish, seeing that
the Sieur de Bèze has been found liable for the whole of the
costs, with restitution of the rents. Whereupon he (Sunistan)
proceeds against the commissioners, who have received them in
the name of the aforesaid De Bèze. To remedy this evil, we
have bethought ourselves, Madame, of having recourse to you
as to a refuge which God vouchsafes to us. We hope, indeed,
that Madame<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> will do much for us. And since it has been
through her that the said Sunistan has got the benefice,
this is a reason why she should have authority to make him
relinquish his claim upon the costs. I assure you, in all
sincerity, that when he shall have done his utmost, he will not
be able to get what he seeks. And therefore, Madame, I again
beseech you, that it may please you to write so urgently to
the said lady, that she may exert herself warmly to make
the aforesaid Sunistan satisfied with the presentation. I do
not make this request so much on my own account, as in the
name of our Master, who has all credit and power with you as
he deserves. I say this, not only to excuse the liberty I take,
but also to obtain more easily from you what I ask. Nevertheless,
I protest in truth, if I did not all I could to deliver
from annoyance the man for whom I speak, I should do wrong
to Jesus Christ and his Church. Our Lord has so wrought
upon him, that he has withdrawn, notwithstanding the ease
which he enjoyed, from the expectation of further advancement.
But I let that alone in order to speak as to what I have known.
I shall not even touch upon many virtues, which would have
won your affections, had you seen them as I have done. I will
only tell you, that he has received excellent graces from God,
and has so improved them for the general benefit of the Church,
that he is truly a pearl. This is why I have said that I less
regard in this case the private individual, than my duty to my
Master and his whole household, who have so much interest
in such a spirit not being quenched by vexations and annoyances.
And I am not the only person who think of him thus,
but all those to whom the honour of God is dear, love and
value this man as a treasure. I believe that my brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
De Normandie does not write of him to you with less affection
than I. We agree in this respect as in everything else, so that
I believe that we both equally love him. You may have some
taste of his mind by certain passages which he has translated,
although he has other gifts which are surpassing and far more
valuable. But I hope, Madame, that the reading of the Psalms,
which you will receive by the bearer,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> will of itself be my
excuse towards you for so pressingly requesting you to be
pleased to be the means of giving him relief, so that he may
follow out this work, and also better things besides: and in
doing so, you will oblige many worthy persons whom I know
you would willingly please....</p>

<h3>Journey of Calvin and Farel in Switzerland&mdash;steps in favour of the Reformed in
France&mdash;return to the affairs of Bolsec.</h3>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">From an Inn at Basle</span>, <i>13th March 1552</i>.</p>

<p>When Farel and I left home, we had resolved to visit you.
At Berne we altered our plan, for the following reason:&mdash;We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
stated in the senate that there appeared some hope of relief
for our unhappy brethren; because the king lately published
an edict, in which he makes unusual concessions to the Germans;
for in the first place he puts them on an equality with
the natives; and further, by an extraordinary indulgence, he
grants them the liberty of living according to their own religion.
Besides, the attempts of the Sorbonne to excite cruelty, have
less success and favour than hitherto. The death of Chatelain<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
also, who was cut off by an attack of colic, happened
seasonably for us. The king seems so bent upon war, that he
does not hesitate to prefer his present convenience to the senseless
rage with which he formerly burned. There are many
things, we think, which at present you may safely concede to
them. It is certain, that in a war so changeable and so complicated
as this, though there may be no formal compact, they
have many common interests involved. Now the miserable
condition of our holy brethren admonishes us of the necessity
of watching over them, and urgently demands that we assist
them to the best of our power. For the king, as if he had
exhausted his kindness upon the Germans, ceases not severely
to oppress his own. Moreover, as many opportunities might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
escape us, from our ignorance of passing events, it had already
seemed to us advisable to turn and warn the Bernese to seize a
favourable opportunity. But now, being taught by much experience
that letters are of little avail, we have besought the Bernese
senate to despatch an embassy, to assure the king that the cause
was sincerely advocated; and that not only from the entreaties
of others, but of your own inclination, and from the deepest
feeling of your heart, you are inclined and earnestly desirous to
plead it. The senate replied, that the occasion seemed not yet
ripe, for that lately letters had been brought from the king,
wherein he not only haughtily refused what the four states had
sought, but fiercely chid them for not considering him a
clement Christian king. It was stated, also, that letters would
presently arrive, from which it would appear whether the
King's mind were changed. The consul promised, however,
that should a convenient opportunity occur, the Senate would
by no means neglect this cause. Among other things, also,
the Senate dissuaded us from going to Zurich, lest unnecessary
expense should be incurred. We were vexed at this, because
we would freely confer with you upon other matters, nor would
you have been displeased at our arrival; however, that we
might not seem too rash, we chose rather to be deprived of the
pleasure of seeing you, and the benefit of your conversation, than
to attempt anything which might injure the cause. Now both
of us beseech you; nay rather all the godly who are suffering
in France for the testimony of Christ, humbly beseech you by
our mouth to be diligently watchful for all opportunities.
Although it is enough to advise you, yet the anxiety under
which we know them to groan, compels us to add some
vehemence to our entreaties. But as we shall certainly not
obtain what we wish, we must exercise moderation, so as not to
give offence to the King. The edict has forty-seven heads.
If in regard to four or five of the heads some reasonable relief
were obtained, the brethren will think themselves not hardly
dealt with. One for instance requires, that on holidays each
with his family be present at the mass, and not only that he
approve that idolatry by his gesture, and defile himself by impious
and faithless hypocrisy, but that the articles of the Sorbonne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
be read aloud at the sacrifice; and thus all will subscribe
to abominable blasphemies. But it is demanded that there be
a rigorous examination of this matter. We must beg of the
King, therefore, that men who pass their lives quietly, giving
offence to none, shall not be eagerly watched, nor be subjected
to the captious demands of the priests. The King confiscates
the goods of those who betake themselves to us,&mdash;to places, as he
says, obviously removed from obedience to the Holy See: nay,
should their property be sold, he orders the purchasers to be
dispossessed. As to this, we must beg that no man shall be
considered a criminal, if, having nothing else laid to his charge,
he willingly and peacefully migrate elsewhere, because he cannot
for conscience sake remain in the kingdom; provided only
that they do not betake themselves to an unfriendly country.
But the first thing to be secured is, that an embassy be resolved
upon. It will appear afterwards what is to be demanded.</p>

<p>To the letters which I received when already on horseback,
I only reply that I had good reason to expostulate, especially
to a brother, in a brotherly way. Consider what we expected
from you in the troubled state of our affairs. Consider, also,
how contrary to our hopes was the answer you gave us; you
may see that we had some cause to grieve. You wonder,
because I utter a moderate and gentle complaint, that we were
assisted less liberally than we had promised ourselves. However,
I make no objection to my letters remaining buried, if
they contained anything offensive.</p>

<p>The little book which I send you, will satisfy you, I hope,
concerning the whole matter.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> You may, however, if you
choose, convey through me your free judgment. My brother's
father-in-law was to have travelled thither with me; but since
God has thrown an obstacle in our way, he writes to his son's
master to keep him till the end of the year, for but a short
time now remains. In the meanwhile, it will be the master's
duty to treat him as a boy who requires a tighter rein and a
severer discipline. Farewell, most accomplished sir, and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
esteemed brother. Salute warmly, in my name, your brethren

keep you under his protection! Amen. The Marquis de
Vico,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and Normandie, and our other companions, desire me

<h3>Agreement to the proposal for assembling a General Synod for the more close union
of the Reformed Churches.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, [<i>April 1552</i>.]
</p>

<p>Your opinion, most distinguished sir, is indeed just and wise,
that in the present disordered condition of the Church, no remedy
can be devised more suitable than if a general meeting were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
held of the devout and the prudent, of those properly exercised
in the school of God, and of those who are confessedly at one
on the doctrine of holiness. For we see how Satan is attempting,
by various devices, to extinguish the light of the Gospel,
which, by the wonderful goodness of God, having risen upon
us, is shining in many a quarter. The hireling dogs of the
Pope cease not to bark, in order to prevent the pure Gospel of
Christ from being heard: so great is the licentiousness that is
here and there breaking forth, and the ungodliness that is
spreading abroad, that religion is become a mere mockery; and
those who are not professed enemies of the truth, nevertheless
conduct themselves with an impropriety which will create in a
short time, unless it be obviated, terrible disorder among us.
And not only among the common herd of men here does the
distemper of a stupid inquisitiveness alternate with that of fearless
extravagance, but, what is more lamentable, in the ranks
of the pastors also the malady is now gaining ground. It is
too well known with what mad actions Osiander is deceiving
himself and deluding certain others.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Yet the Lord, as he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
done even from the beginning of the world, will preserve in a
miraculous manner, and in a way unknown to us, the unity of
a pure faith from being destroyed by the dissensions of men.
And those whom he has placed on his watch-tower he wishes
least of all to be inactive, seeing that he has appointed them
to be his ministers, through whose labours he may preserve
from all corruptions sound doctrine in the Church, and transmit
it safe to posterity. Especially, most illustrious Archbishop,
is it necessary for you, in proportion to the distinguished position
you occupy, to turn your attention as you are doing towards
this object. I do not say this as if to spur you on to greater
exertions, who are not only, of your own accord, in advance of
others, but are also, as a voluntary encourager, urging them
on; I say it in order that, by my congratulations, you may be
strengthened in a pursuit so auspicious and noble. I hear that
the success of the Gospel in England is indeed cheering; but
you will experience there also, I doubt not, what Paul experienced
in his time, that by means of the door that has been
opened for the reception of pure doctrine, many enemies will
suddenly rise up against it. Although I am really ignorant of
how many suitable defenders you may have at hand to repel
the lies of Satan, still the ungodliness of those who are wholly
taken up in creating disturbances, causes the assiduity of the
well-disposed to be at no time either too much or superfluous.
And then I am aware that English matters are not so all-important
in your eyes, but that you, at the same time, regard the
interest of the whole world. Moreover, the rare piety of the
English King, as well as his noble disposition, is worthy of the
highest commendation, in that, of his own inclination, he entertains
the pious design of holding a convention of the nature
referred to, and offers a place for it also in his own kingdom.
And would that it were attainable to bring together into some
place, from various Churches, men eminent for their learning, and
that after having carefully discussed the main points of belief one
by one, they should, from their united judgments, hand down to
posterity the true doctrine of Scripture. This other thing also
is to be ranked among the chief evils of our time, viz., that the
Churches are so divided, that human fellowship is scarcely now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
in any repute amongst us, far less that Christian intercourse
which all make a profession of, but few sincerely practise. If
men of learning conduct themselves with more reserve than is
seemly, the very heaviest blame attaches to the leaders themselves,
who, either engrossed in their own sinful pursuits, are
indifferent to the safety and entire piety of the Church, or who,
individually satisfied with their own private peace, have no
regard for others. Thus it is that the members of the Church
being severed, the body lies bleeding. So much does this concern
me, that, could I be of any service, I would not grudge to
cross even ten seas, if need were, on account of it. If it were
but a question regarding the rendering of assistance to the
kingdom of England, such a motive would at present be to me
a sufficiently just one. Now, seeing that a serious and properly
adjusted agreement between men of learning upon the rule of
Scripture is still a desideratum, by means of which Churches,
though divided on other questions, might be made to unite, I
think it right for me, at whatever cost of toil and trouble, to
seek to obtain this object. But I hope my own insignificance
will cause me to be passed by. If I earnestly pray that it may
be undertaken by others, I hope I shall have discharged my
duty. Mr. Philip [Melanchthon] is at too great a distance to
admit of a speedy interchange of letters. Mr. Bullinger has
likely written you before this time. Would that I were as able
as I am willing to exert myself! Moreover, the very difficulty
of the thing which you feel, compels me to do what, at the outset,
I affirmed I would not do, viz., not only to encourage, but
also to implore you to increase your exertions, until something
at least shall have been accomplished, if not all that we
could desire.&mdash;Adieu, very distinguished Archbishop, deserving
of my hearty reverence. May the Lord continue to guide
you by his Spirit, and to bless your holy labours!</p>

<p>After having resided for some time at Paris, this pious young
man retired among you, and, judging from his conduct, I have
no doubt but that he has really the fear of God in him, and is
of a truly modest character. He studied the humanities with
considerable success, has since entered upon theology, and now,
that he may make greater progress in this study, he has resolved
to enter your College and Church. Although he is not
inclined to trouble you, nor, as I trust, any one else, yet as he
appeared to me to be a person of pure and simple piety, I did
not choose to send him away without this testimony. Our
two friends who lately went among you have not yet returned.
Would that our pious brethren experienced some relief!<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>

of the kingdom also. We must, therefore, be busy while we

<h3>Information on various doctrinal points, and assurances of Christian sympathy.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 10th of June 1552</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Brethren</span>,&mdash;Hitherto I have put off writing
to you, fearing that if the letter fell into bad hands, it might
give fresh occasion to the enemy to afflict you. And besides,
I had been informed how that God wrought so powerfully in
you by his grace, that you stood in no great need of my letters.
However, we have not forgotten you, neither I nor all the brethren
hereabouts, as to whatever we have been able to do for you.
As soon as you were taken, we heard of it, and knew how it had
come to pass. We took care that help might be sent you with
all speed, and are now waiting the result. Those who have
influence with the prince in whose power God has put your
lives, are faithfully exerting themselves on your behalf, but we
do not yet know how far they have succeeded in their suit.
Meanwhile, all the children of God pray for you as they are
bound to do, not only on account of the mutual compassion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
which ought to exist between members of the same body,
but because they know well that you labour for them, in maintaining
the cause of their salvation. We hope, come what may,
that God of his goodness will give a happy issue to your captivity,
so that we shall have reason to rejoice. You see to what
he has called you; doubt not, therefore, that according as he
employs you, he will give you strength to fulfil his work, for
he has promised this, and we know by experience that he has
never failed those who allow themselves to be governed by him.
Even now you have proof of this in yourselves, for he has shown
his power, by giving you so much constancy in withstanding
the first assaults. Be confident, therefore, that he will not
leave the work of his hand imperfect. You know what Scripture
sets before us, to encourage us to fight for the cause of the
Son of God; meditate upon what you have both heard and seen
formerly on this head, so as to put it in practice. For all that
I could say would be of little service to you, were it not drawn
from this fountain. And truly we have need of a much more
firm support than that of men, to make us victorious over such
strong enemies as the devil, death, and the world; but the
firmness which is in Christ Jesus is sufficient for this, and all
else that might shake us were we not established in him.
Knowing, then, in whom ye have believed, manifest what
authority he deserves to have over you.</p>

<p>As I hope to write to you again, I shall not at present
lengthen my letter. I shall only reply briefly to the point which
brother Bernard has asked me to solve. Concerning vows, we
must hold to this rule, that it is not lawful to vow to God anything
but what he approves. Now the fact is, that monastic
vows tend only to corrupt his service. As for the second question,
we must hold that it is devilish presumption for a man to
vow beyond the measure of his vocation. Now, the Scripture
declares, both in the nineteenth of St. Matthew and in the
seventh of the First to the Corinthians, that the gift of continence
is a special grace. It follows, then, that those who put
themselves in the position and under the necessity of renouncing
marriage for the whole of their life, cannot be acquitted of rashness,
and that by so doing they tempt God. The question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
might very easily be spun out to a greater length, by stating
that we ought to consider, first, who He is to whom we vow;
secondly, the nature of that vow; and thirdly, the party making
the vow. For God is too great a master for us to trifle with,
and man is bound to consider his own capabilities; for to present
a sacrifice without obedience, is nothing but thorough
pollution. However, this one point may suffice you to prove
to them that the gift of continence is a special gift, and in
suchwise special, that for the most part it is only for a season.
So that he who possessed it for thirty years, like Isaac, may
not do so for the remainder of his life. Hence you may conclude,
that the monks, in binding themselves never to marry,
attempt without faith to promise what is not given to them.
As for their poverty, it is quite the reverse of that which our
Lord enjoined upon his followers.</p>

<p>Concerning the nature of a glorified body, true it is, that the
qualities thereof are changed, but not entirely. For we must
distinguish between the qualities which proceed from the corruption
of sin, and those which belong to and are inseparable
from the nature of the body. St. Paul, in the third chapter of
the Epistle to the Philippians, says that our vile or weak body
shall be made like to the glorious body of Christ. By this
humble expression or <em>Tapinosis</em>, he points out which of the qualities
that we at present bear about with us in our bodies are
to be changed; those, namely, which are of the corruptible and
fading nature of this world. And on this subject St. Augustine
says, in <cite>the Epistle to Dardanus</cite>, which in number is the 57th,
"<em>He shall come again in the same form and substance of the
flesh, to which certainly he gave immortality; he hath not taken
away the nature. In this form he must not be supposed to be everywhere
diffused.</em>" This argument he follows out at greater
length, showing that the body of Christ is contained within its
own dimensions. And in fact our glorified bodies will not be
ubiquitous, although they will have that likeness of which St.
Paul speaks. As for the passage of the Apocalypse, the words
are these in the fifth chapter: "<em>And every creature which is in
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in
the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
<em>honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</em>" Now you see
that it is a childish cavil to apply this to souls in purgatory;
for St. John, by the figure which is called <em>Prosopop&oelig;ia</em>, rather
conveys that even the fishes blessed God. And in regard to
the passages of the Doctors, refer your people to the 27th
Epistle of St. Augustine, <cite>To Boniface</cite>, where he states, toward
the end, <em>that the sacraments have a certain similitude of those
things which they represent</em>. <em>From whence it comes to pass, that
after some fashion the sacrament of the body of Christ may be the
body of Christ.</em> Item, that which he treats of in the third book,
<cite>Of Christian Doctrine</cite>, where he says, among other things in
the fifth chapter, "<em>Such is the completely miserable bondage of
the soul in conceiving of the signs in place of the things signified,
and never lifting up the eye of the understanding above the corporeal
creature to breathe eternal light</em>." Item, in the ninth chapter.&mdash;"<em>The
believer knows by experience, and understands</em>,
[agnoscit] <em>to what the mystery of baptism, and the celebration of
the body and blood of the Lord, may be referred, so that the soul
can offer religious worship, not in the bondage of the flesh, but
rather in the liberty of the spirit. So to follow the literal sense,
and in suchwise to conceive of the signs instead of the things sealed
or signified by them, is a slavish weakness; that mere symbols
should be so unprofitably interpreted, is the result of vague error</em>."
I do not heap up quotations, because these will be quite
enough for your purpose. In conclusion, I beseech our good
Lord that he would be pleased to make you feel in every way
the worth of his protection of his own, to fill you with his
Holy Spirit who gives you prudence and virtue, and brings
you peace, joy, and contentment; and may the name of our
Lord Jesus be glorified by you to the edification of his
Church!</p>

<h3>Dedication of a new work, and Christian exhortations.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 4th July 1552</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,&mdash;Although I ought to fear lest my importunity may
prove troublesome to your Majesty, and have indeed on that
account abstained from writing to you more frequently, nevertheless,
I have had the boldness to send you, together with my
letters, a short exposition which I have composed of the 78th
(87th)<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Psalm, hoping that you would take pleasure in it, and
also that the reading thereof might be profitable to you. As I
was one day expounding it in a sermon to the people, the argument
appeared to me so appropriate for you, that I was forthwith
moved to draw up a summary of it, such as you will see,
when it shall please your Majesty to devote to it one hour only.
It is very true, that I treat the subject generally, without addressing
you personally. But as I have mainly had regard to
you in the writing of it, so in the prudent application and
appropriation of it, you will find that it contains a very profitable
lesson for your Majesty.</p>

<p>You know, Sire, how much danger kings and princes are in,
lest the height to which they are raised should dazzle their
eyes, and amuse them here below, while making them forgetful
of the heavenly kingdom; and I doubt not that God hath so
warned you against this evil, to preserve you therefrom, that
you are a hundred times more impressed with it, than those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
who have no personal experience of it. Now, in the present
Psalm mention is made of the nobleness and dignity of the
Church, which ought so to enrapture both great and small, that
no earthly honours and possessions should hold them back, or
hinder them from aiming to be enrolled among the people of
God. It is indeed a great thing to be a king, and yet more,
over such a country; nevertheless, I have no doubt that you
reckon it beyond comparison better to be a Christian. It is
therefore an invaluable privilege that God has vouchsafed you,
Sire, to be a Christian king, to serve as his lieutenant in ordering
and maintaining the kingdom of Jesus Christ in England.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
You see, then, that in acknowledgment of such great benefits
received from his infinite goodness, you ought to be stirred up
to employ all your energies to his honour and service, setting
to your subjects an example of homage to this great King, to
whom your Majesty is not ashamed to submit yourself with
all humility and reverence beneath the spiritual sceptre of his
Gospel; and if hitherto you have done this, so that we have
cause to glorify God for his goodness, the present Psalm will
always serve you as a support and a buckler. Meanwhile, I
humbly entreat you, Sire, that this short letter may serve as a
protest and testimony to your Majesty of the hearty desire I
have to do better, if the means were given me.</p>

<p>Sire, after having very humbly commended me to your kind
favour, I pray our Lord to fill you with the gifts of his Holy
Spirit, to guide you in all prudence and virtue, to make you
prosper and flourish to the glory of his name.</p>

<p>Your very humble and obedient servant,</p>

<h3>Calvin exhorts him to prosecute with fresh zeal the Reformation of the Church in
England, by purging it of the relics of Popery.</h3>


<p class="sig">[<i>July 1552.</i>]</p>

<p>Seeing that, at the present time, that which is most of all to
be desired is least likely to be attained, viz., that an assembly
of the most eminent men of learning, from all the various
Churches which have embraced the pure doctrine of the Gospel,
after having discussed separately the controverted topics of the
day, might transmit to posterity, out of the pure word of God,
a true and distinct confession; I nevertheless highly commend
the plan which you, reverend sir, have adopted, to make the
English frame for themselves, without delay, a religious constitution,
lest, by matters remaining longer in an unsettled state,
or not being sufficiently adjusted, the minds of the common
people should be confirmed in their suspense. And it is the
duty of all in your country, who have any influence, to direct
their energies with united zeal toward this object, so that your
duties may still be special. You see what such a position as
yours demands, or rather what God may legitimately require of
you in consideration of the nature of the office which he has
imposed on you. Supreme authority is vested in you&mdash;an
authority which your high rank entitles you to, not more than
the previously entertained opinion regarding your wisdom and
integrity. The eyes of many are fixed upon you, either to
second your exertions, or to imitate your lukewarmness. And
sincerely do I desire that, under your leadership, they may be
advanced to such an extent during the next three years, that
the difficulties and contests of the present time, caused by the
removing of the grossest superstition, shall have ceased to exist.
I, for my part, acknowledge that our cause has made no little
progress during the short period the Gospel has flourished in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
England. But if you reflect on what yet remains to be done,
and how very remiss you have been in many matters, you will
discover that you have no reason to advance towards the goal
with less rapidity, even although the most of the course has, as
it were, been gone over; for I need not inform you that I, as
it were, take note of your assiduity, lest, after having escaped
danger, you should become self-indulgent. But to speak freely,
I greatly fear, and this fear is abiding, that so many autumns
will be spent in procrastinating, that by and by the cold of a
perpetual winter will set in. You are now somewhat advanced
in years, and this ought to stimulate you to increased exertions,
so as to save yourself the regret of having been consciously
dilatory, and that you may not leave the world while matters
remain in so disordered a condition. I say matters are still
in a disorganized state, for external religious abuses have been
corrected in such a way as to leave remaining innumerable
young shoots, which are constantly sprouting forth. In fact, I
am informed that such a mass of Papal corruptions remains, as
not only to hide, but almost to extinguish the pure worship of
God. Meanwhile the life of the whole ecclesiastical order is all
but extinct, or at least is not sufficiently vigorous: take, for
example, the preaching of doctrine. Assuredly pure and undefiled
religion will never flourish, until the Churches shall have
been at greater pains to secure suitable pastors, and such as
shall conscientiously discharge the duties of teaching. Satan,
indeed, opposes his secret wiles to the accomplishment of this.
I understand that there is still one shameful obstacle, viz., that
the revenues of the Church have been plundered; truly an insufferable
evil. But iniquitous as this is, there appears to me
to be another vice of equal magnitude, viz., that out of the
public revenues of the Church, idle gluttons are supported who
chant vespers in an unknown tongue. I shall say nothing farther
on this point, except that it is inconsistent for you to
approve of such mockery, and it is openly incompatible with
the proper arrangements of the Church; besides, it is in itself
exceedingly ridiculous. I do not doubt, however, but that these
considerations will immediately occur to your own mind, and
will be suggested to you by that most upright man Peter Martyr,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
whose counsel I am exceedingly glad to know you enjoy.
Difficulties so numerous and so trying as those against which
you are contending, appear to me a sufficient excuse for the
exhortations I have offered.&mdash;Adieu, most distinguished and
esteemed Primate. May the Lord long preserve you in safety;
may he fill you more and more with the Spirit of wisdom and
fortitude, and bless your labours! Amen.</p>

agreeable to him than our striving to comfort and help them
as much as in us lies. The Lord Jesus declares, that whatsoever
shall have been done to one of the least of his people,
will be acknowledged by him as done to himself. How then
if we have furthered those who fight his battles? For such
are as it were his agents, whom he appoints and ordains for
the defence of his Gospel. Yea, he declares that a cup of
water given to them shall not be lost. If then you have
hitherto had the courage to present so goodly a sacrifice to
God, strive to persevere. I know well that the devil will not
fail to whisper in your ear on many sides to divert you from
it, but let God prove the strongest, as is meet he should. It
is said that they who comfort the children of God in their persecutions
which they endure for the Gospel, are fellow-labourers
for the truth. Be content with this testimony, for it is no light
matter that God should uphold and approve us as his martyrs,
even though we do not personally suffer, merely because his
martyrs are helped and comforted by us. And, therefore,
although many tell you the contrary, do not leave off so good a
work, or show yourself weary half-way. I feel assured that you
did not look to men at the first; follow on then as the servant
of Him to whom we must cleave to the end. Reflect, moreover,
how many worthy brethren there are who glorify God for what
you are doing, who would be scandalized if you altered your
course. As for the dangers which they set before you, I have
no fear of their coming to pass, for the good brethren for whom
you have done so much, feel themselves so indebted to you,
that were they at liberty, far from being cowardly enough to
betray you, they would expose themselves to death for your
sake. You must also consider, that by the support which they
receive from you, they are the more confirmed, for they have
no doubt whatever that God has directed you to them, as indeed
he has. And they have reason to lean still more firmly upon
him, seeing the paternal care he shews them. Be of good
courage, therefore, in this holy work, in which you serve not
only God and his martyrs, but also the whole Church.</p>

<p>Whereupon, my very dear sir and brother, after having
heartily commended myself to you, I pray our good Lord that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
he would increase you more and more with the gifts and riches
of his Spirit, for the furtherance of his own honour; and
meanwhile, that he would have you in his keeping.</p>

<h3>Exhortations to harmony&mdash;Is it lawful to call Mary the Mother of God, and to pray
for the Pope?</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 27th September 1552</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear and honoured Brethren</span>,&mdash;As I desire your
quiet, to the end that, being at peace among yourselves, you may
be the better enabled and disposed to serve God, and may do
so with the greater courage, I have grieved for the trouble which
some inconsiderate people have occasioned you, and grieved
doubly because they made a cloak of me and of this Church in
order to trouble you. Now, as they did us injustice in that, it
appears to me that you ought to have been too reasonable and
humane to suffer us to be mixed up and implicated in their
follies. One of them, of whom I had heard complaint made,
will bear me witness that I have not encouraged him in his
fault since his return, but have rather endeavoured to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
him feel and understand it, although M. A Lasco had written to
me confidentially that all had been forgiven. I mention this,
because I have heard that they have been reproached with wishing
to make an idol of me and a Jerusalem of Geneva. I have
not deserved that your Church should treat me thus, and even
were there twice the amount of ingratitude, I should not cease
to seek your welfare. But I am constrained to warn you of it,
for such proceedings are calculated rather to ruin than to edify.
And however I may seek to bury such matters in oblivion, I
cannot hinder many from being offended by them. If those
who have stirred up these conflicts have taken occasion to do
so from the diversity of ceremonies, as M. A Lasco has informed
me,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> they have but ill understood in what the true unity of
Christians consists, and how every member is bound to conform
himself to the body of the Church in which he lives. It is
true, that if a different form has been seen and preferred, it is
quite allowable in communicating first of all with the pastor,
to tell him what is thought of it, provided one accommodates
one's-self to the usages of the place where one lives, without
clamouring for novelty, but peaceably conforming to any order
that is not repugnant to the word of God. Now, how the two
persons in question have proceeded I know not, unless I give
credit to the testimony which has been furnished me, namely,
that there has been a great want of consideration, and that
they have neither observed due measure nor modesty. But this
I say, because it is well to set such persons right by gentleness,
rather than to make matters worse by over-violent remedies.
Not that I mean to say that they have been too severely dealt
with, but that I have heard it so reported, although I do not
believe it. I think you will not take it ill that I let you
know this, as it can do you no harm.</p>

<p>Concerning the other debatable points, I doubt not but
there may have been somewhat of ignorance in their reproving
the way of speaking of the Virgin Mary as the
mother of God, and together with ignorance, it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
that there may have been rashness and too much forwardness,
for, as the old proverb says, The most ignorant are ever the
boldest. However, to deal with you with brotherly frankness,
I cannot conceal that that title being commonly attributed to
the Virgin in sermons is disapproved, and, for my own part,
I cannot think such language either right, or becoming, or
suitable. Neither will any sober-minded people do so, for
which reason I cannot persuade myself that there is any such
usage in your church, for it is just as if you were to speak of
the blood, of the head, and of the death of God. You know
that the Scriptures accustom us to a different style; but there
is something still worse about this particular instance, for to
call the Virgin Mary the mother of God, can only serve to
confirm the ignorant in their superstitions. And he that would
take a pleasure in that, shews clearly that he knows not what
it is to edify the Church.</p>

<p>As for the name of the Bishop of Rome, that is a foolish
question to dwell upon. We bestow too much honour upon
those horned cattle in calling them bishops, for the name is
too honourable for them. Neither does the title of Pope any
better suit the brigand who has usurped God's seat. In reference
to this, I would follow unbiassed that which is commonly
received. The chief practical point of difference is about the
form of prayer. I know that we must make a due distinction
between the individual and the abominable and accursed seat (of
the beast). But I do think that those who pray specially for
him who bears such a mark of reprobation, have surely much
time to spare. I lay down laws for no one, but it were much
to be desired that the sobriety of our prayers should shew the
reverence we feel for the name of God. I speak with such
freedom as you ought to bear from a brother, and I hope, too,
that you will bear with it; for I shall be quite ready to suffer
the word of admonition from you whenever you disapprove of
what I write to you. Moreover, when you have well weighed
the matter, and that each is willing, without contention, to submit
to the truth, I hope that harmony will easily be established
amongst us. Furthermore, if this annoyance has been hard
upon you, have some compassion upon us, who have here daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
far more rude encounters to sustain. And for my part, I
shall continue to pray our good Lord as I do, that it would
please him to increase you more and more in the graces of his
Spirit, to make your labours profitable, and to strengthen your
hands in the exercise of the rule which he has committed to
you. And my brethren will do the same, for I know their
mind towards you.</p>

<h2>CCCI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To the Seigneurs of Geneva</span>.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></h2>

<h3>Reply of Calvin to the Syndics of Geneva in the case of Trolliet.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>6th October 1552.</i>
</p>

<p>The answer of John Calvin, minister of the word of God in
the Church of God, presented this Tuesday, the 6th of October
1552, to our honourable Lords Messieurs the Syndics and
Council, against the writing produced on the Monday preceding,
by the Seigneur Trolliet:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, Messieurs, as for what he terms his written
defence in his disputation against me, I do not understand what
he aims at, nor for what purpose he says this, unless to acquire
reputation with the ignorant, from having disputed with John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Calvin. And your Excellencies know what the whole procedure
was, namely, that he became confused, having no reply
to make, except that he did not understand it. Wherefore, it
would be well that he should get rid of vain-glory, which has
too much incited him already to give unnecessary trouble and
annoyance, as well to himself as to others. For had he walked
as modestly as he ought, according to his measure, this contention
would never have arisen.</p>

<p>But the worst is, that he pretends to sustain his charge
against me, and, nevertheless, misrepresents the whole argument.
For the point which was debated on the first day of
September, was that he charged me with making God the
author of sin, which I denied with all due protestation, for it is
an utterly execrable blasphemy. Whereupon he attempted to
prove it, alleging the passages which he cites in his written
representation. So that the main point of our case, as he has
maintained in your presence more than ten times over, lies in
this,&mdash;Whether I have made God the cause of evil and of sin,
or not. And but for this, there was no difficulty whatever regarding
this first point. For I do not disavow anything that
I have written. But I say that we ought to have a horror of
applying the word sin, to God; seeing that in him there is
nothing but all equity and justice, even as he is both the rule
and the fountain thereof. Wherefore I am amazed that he was
not ashamed of denying it. But be that as it may, if he be
obstinate in his denial, I require, as right and reason enjoins,
that it may please you, before going farther, to order your
secretary to give me an act and extract to that effect. For I
ought not, and cannot suffer such a reproach to be fastened
upon me, without clearing myself as I ought. Moreover, in
the sentences which he quotes as extracts from my <cite>Institution</cite>,
he does me great wrong, having given them in a detached and
garbled form. And he even thrusts in and mixes up with the
doctrine which is avowedly mine, the objections which are
made to it by blasphemers. He ought to have been much
ashamed, when I demonstrated that by such means Saint Paul
might be charged with having called God unrighteous. But
that he should persist in such a course, is altogether unbearable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Again, that which he brings forward on the first page,
from leaf 461, is wrongly stated, and contrary to my true
meaning, seeing that he accumulates there what I have said
about the wicked, whom I reprove and condemn.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>However, I am free to confess, that I have stated that God
not only has foreseen, but also foreordained, the fall of Adam,
which I maintain to be true,<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> not without good grounds and
evidences from holy writ. The opposite party, without alluding
to the proofs which I bring forward, says that I have
spoken amiss, and at the same time can allege nothing to shew
that I have done so, except, indeed, that he is pleased to
arrive at that conclusion. Judge, Messieurs, whether this be
equitable.</p>

<p>On the second proposition:&mdash;</p>

<p>As to his accusing me of having written&mdash;That man is by
the ordinance and will of God under the necessity of sinning;
I much wish, as I have so often said, that people would not
attribute to me that jargon of the monks, which I have never
used. And indeed it is only those hypocrites who have ever
twaddled thus. Let then the doctrine, as I state it, be attentively
considered, and I am ready to acknowledge that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
wicked, sin of necessity, and that such necessity is by the ordinance
and will of God; but I also add, that such necessity is
without constraint, so that he who sins, cannot excuse himself
by saying, that he was compelled thereto. And I prove this
doctrine so clearly from holy Scripture, that it is impossible
for any living man to resist it. And it amazes me, that the
adverse party should not display his subtlety in controverting
what I have said before you, and that he even conceals the
proofs which I have abundantly brought forward in my books.
He says that he has maintained contrary opinions, without the
will or the power to approve of mine. But were he the most
learned personage in the world, it would be too much to insist
upon being believed, while simply answering that he neither
will nor can consent to what is proposed to him. So much
the less reason is there for a man who is scarcely at all versed
in the holy Scriptures, and who is no competent judge in
theological matters, to expect that those to whom God has
vouchsafed grace to understand them a little better, should be
reproved according to his fancy. Now, then, honourable Seigneurs,
if the proofs which you have heard are not sufficient, I
offer to make them more complete, as often and whenever it
may please you. And for the rest, I refer to what is contained
in the Book concerning the predestination and providence of
God.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>On the contradictions which the Seigneur Trolliet has
imagined.</p>

<p>The opposing party thinks that I contradict myself, when I
teach that a man ought rather to search for the cause of his
condemnation in his corrupt nature, than in the predestination
of God; and does not see that I there expressly state, that
there are two causes, the one concealed in the eternal counsel
of God, and the other open and manifest, in the sin of man.
Now, since he confesses that this is true, he condemns himself
by his own mouth and sign-manual. And as for me, I willingly
accept that confession, which shews plainly that he has
never understood a single point of the case which he discusses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
so boldly. Here, then, Messieurs, is the very core of the whole
question: that I say, that all the reprobate will be convicted of
guilt by their own consciences, and that thus their condemnation
is righteous, and that they err in neglecting what is quite
evident, to enter instead into the secret counsels of God, which
to us are inaccessible. The Scripture, however, shews us
clearly, that God has predestined men to such ends as he chose
them to reach. But as to why or how this is done, we must
remain ignorant, because it has not been revealed to us.</p>

<p>Touching the contradiction which the adverse party conceits
that he has brought forward from the second page of the 463d
leaf, it is marvellous, that after having been so disgracefully
cast in such a frivolous objection, he should return to it anew.
I say, in that passage, that it is perverse to pry into the secrets
of God whereto we are unable to attain, in order to search for
the origin of the condemnation of mankind, while passing over
the corruption of their nature, from whence it manifestly proceeds.
However, this does not mean that the counsel of God
does not overrule in a sovereign degree the disposal of everything,
although proximate causes may strike our eyes. That
were as much as to find a contradiction in these propositions,
which are all those of holy writ: That man is not nourished
by his labour, nor by his industry, but by the grace of God
alone. That it is not the heat or influence of the sun which
makes the earth fruitful, but the pure grace of God. That it
is not bread that sustains and nourishes us, but the strength
which God of his goodness puts into us. And on the other
hand, that the idle man deserves to starve. Item, that the
earth will deny us pasturage. Item, that we are sustained and
strengthened by bread. Now the solution is quite easy when
we learn to distinguish between the sovereign cause, and those
which are secondary, and more upon a level with human understanding.</p>

<p>As to the passages extracted out of the book of Melanchthon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
I confess that God is not the author of sin. I have even expressly
maintained this article of faith in my books, and as
warmly as could be required from a faithful servant of God.
It is therefore superfluous to set up this as a matter of dispute
between us. Notwithstanding, I must confess, as I have
formerly declared, that the method of instruction which Melanchthon
adopts, is different from mine. I have also, honourable
Seigneurs, explained to you the cause of this. It is, that
Melanchthon, being a timorous man, has accommodated himself
too much to the common feeling of mankind, that he might
not give occasion to over-curious people to seek to pry into the
secret things of God. And thus, as at last appears, he has
spoken of the present question rather as a philosopher than a
theologian, having no better authority to rest upon than that of
Plato. And then evidently he aims at a middle course, as if
he would confess that he swam between two currents, which is
what the adverse party ought to take rather more into account.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>As for the rest, most honourable Seigneurs, he who would
place Melanchthon and myself in opposition, greatly wrongs
both the one and the other, as well as the whole Church of
God. I honour Melanchthon as much on account of the excellent
knowledge which is in him, as for his virtues; and
more than all, because of his having laboured faithfully to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
further the Gospel. If I find anything to reprove, I do not
conceal it from him, as he gives me full liberty not to do so. As
for him, there are witnesses more than enough, who know how
much he loves me. And I know that he would detest those
who sought to shelter themselves behind him, to disparage
my doctrine in any way. Moreover, such sort of people only
seek to sow tares and scandals to obstruct the course of the
Gospel. I shall not waste my time in disproving these propositions,
brought forward by the adverse party, in which
Melanchthon gives satisfaction to none of the learned, because
he yields to too tender a caution, not venturing to say what
he knows to be true, because he fears that all may not be
capable of hearing it. It suffices that I have produced to you
letters under his hand, wherein appears what I have advanced.
But even if license were given to the adverse party to form
any conclusion he might think proper, and to make what
resolutions he liked upon the writings of learned men, you
would be at his mercy as to receiving three Sacraments,&mdash;among
which is the confessional, because, forsooth, Melanchthon
receives them. This I merely mention, that he may learn to
know himself better, and not to be so excessively eager to
throw himself into the battle-field.</p>

<p>As for myself, most honourable Seigneurs, having the assurance
of my conscience, that what I have taught and written
has not been the creation of my own brain, but that I have
had it from God, it must needs be that I maintain it, as I
think I have fully done, if I would not prove traitor to the
truth. And should it seem good to you, I offer anew to reply
more fully, until the adverse party be convicted of having
falsely accused me, contrary to all truth and reason.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<h3>Conspiracy of the Libertines&mdash;energy of the Reformer&mdash;struggles of Viret at
Lausanne.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th October 1552</i>.
</p>

<p>I occasionally abstain from writing, from having nothing
important to write about, but my material is in these days
more abundant than I could wish&mdash;so much so, that it has
kept me from writing altogether. For I think it better silently
to repress the very sad cares which torture me, rather than
seek consolation by inconveniencing you. Even if I did throw
part of the burden on your shoulders, I should rather increase
than diminish the evil. The very act of writing, moreover, by
awakening the memory, irritates the wound. I was aware that
our enemies were making secret preparations for an insurrection,
for four months past; the fire was to be kindled at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
next election, in the month of November, when it is customary
to appoint the chief magistrate. Bernard had given me a hint
of it. But we were ignorant of the charge by which they
thought to oppress and even overwhelm us. But the Lord has
seasonably dragged them forth to the light. They spread a
rumour among the petty tradesmen, and then bawled out in
the assembly hall, that forty thousand pieces of gold were deposited
with three Frenchmen, as a reward for betraying the
city. They made indirect allusions to the three guardians of
the poor, among whom was Du Tailly, whom the Lord lately
called to himself, and who is very greatly lamented by all the
pious. Wendel was not ashamed to allege, in the presence of
the Senate, that there were three hundred thousand. This
conjecture deceived them, for, when they had hoped, by their
atrocious calumny to kindle a fire which should consume us in
a moment, the flame by and by ended in smoke. They are,
notwithstanding, in the meantime, acting with careless effrontery,
seeing, as they do, the inactivity of those who ought to
have mended matters, which they could have done with the
utmost ease had they possessed a single spark of manliness.
For what would not the wicked dare when there is impunity
for all evils? But I trust that Christ will ere long prove our
deliverer.</p>

<p>He<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> has neglected what he had promised to Viret. I, for my
part, am doing all I can to refresh his memory. But he is
amusing himself with us. It were better, therefore, for Viret
to come of his own accord. The proper time would be, however,
before the Martinalia, when despair will drive our enemies
to act like the Bacchæ if he does not make his appearance.
But he is drawn away elsewhere. And the affairs which he has
in hand are to me of so much importance, that I consider it
sinful to place any obstacle in his way, or to offer the very least
hindrance.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> On the contrary, I feel exceedingly ashamed that
I have afforded him no more comfort under so great difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
than if I had been buried. Although, therefore, most
anxious that you should encourage us with your presence, it
must nevertheless be deferred until another occasion, especially
as it would be better that both of you should be present at
the same time. I scarcely know what to say regarding Garnier's
letter.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The specimen which I had lately of his character
in a private matter, will prevent me in future from
having any dealings with him. You will say the public position
of the Church is concerned. Pardon my timidity, for I
fear very much that no men are more insolent and haughty,
than those of a servile disposition. Had it been convenient
for Viret to come here, nothing could have been more useful
and appropriate, than for us to hold a consultation on the
leading topics, before the matter had proceeded farther. I
fear, however, that it will be scarcely possible for Viret to be
here before the completion of the Bernese embassy. Accordingly,
I have no one to consult with, unless I lay the matter
before my fellow-ministers. I am persuaded, however, that no
settlement should be come to, until you reach us.</p>

<p>Adieu, most upright and very dear brother. Salute that
noble man, the Seigneur de Dammartin, your colleague, and
the rest of our friends. May the Lord guard you all by his
protection, enrich you with the gifts of his Spirit, and bless
you in all things. Amen.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p>After I had written Farel, our friend Gerold undertook,
at my request, to make a journey thither. There is, accordingly
a letter designed for both of you, which, having read, you
will show to him at your own convenience. I ask no more
of you than that you will think of us when it suits you. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>

as I have handed over the task to Baduel as if with his permission.
Indeed, I felt ashamed, from the first, that his valuable
time should be taken up with work so very unworthy of
him&mdash;time that could and ought to be better occupied. I, on
this account, embraced the more gladly the opportunity afforded
me of laying the burden on another. He will be urged
by and by, by our friend Robert, to engage in a sort of lucubration
in which he will be of greater advantage to the Church.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>&mdash;Adieu,

<h3>Troubles at Geneva&mdash;sad intelligence from France and Germany&mdash;steady in the
promises of God.</h3>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>19th November 1552</i>.</p>

<p>As I hope that my dearly beloved brother Beza will be with
you about the same time that you receive this letter, and as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
will inform you more fully as to my own state and that of the
Church than I can in the longest epistle, I shall at present be
brief. He will tell you the annoyance and disturbance we suffered
from some worthless wretches, whose sole power of injuring
us lies in the impunity and license which is allowed them. But
God apparently wishes us to be destitute of human aid, that
himself alone may protect us. In the meantime, though I
little expected it, I live a survivor of my native town. The
city in which I was born has lately been utterly destroyed by
fire.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> We are also compelled to hear daily of fearful disasters
throughout all Picardy, but so far is the King's fierceness from
being subdued by them, that never was his pride more insulting
to God. I wish that I might at length hear from your
beloved Germany something that might cheer me; yet as nothing
now appears but what is saddening, or at least confused,
I scarcely venture to ask what is doing there. And I suppose
you also are filled with alarm whenever any news is announced,
fearing lest some addition be made to the existing evils. Unless
the Lord stretch forth his hand to us from heaven, the wise
and far-sighted perceive that these misfortunes, severe and
bitter as they are, are but a gentle prelude to tremendous calamities.
But although Satan is going about everywhere with
fearful license, yet if we consider the desperate wickedness of
the world, it is wonderful that God has not given him much
greater liberty. But we who have our anchor fixed in heaven,
must sail amid these troubled storms just as in the peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
haven, until the Lord brings us to the blissful rest of his own
kingdom.</p>

<p>F&mdash;&mdash; promised to hand over to you, my letters to Beza.
If he has not come to you, he will send them to Farel at his
earliest opportunity. Robert Stephens has my Commentary
on John in the press.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> As soon as he has finished it, I shall
cause a copy to be sent to you.</p>

<p>Adieu, most distinguished sir, and excellent servant of Christ,
deserving of my hearty regard. May the Lord continue to
guide you by his Spirit, to shield you by his protection, and
to bestow upon you every kind of blessing. Salute your fellow-minister
earnestly in my name. My colleagues both salute
you, and those who were lately my companions. I desire you
to convey my regards to the treasurer of your city, and to the
other pious and wise men. I beseech you very earnestly to
remember me in your prayers, for I am more in need of this
aid at present than words can express. Adieu, together with
your wife and family.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<h3>Earnest desires for the continuance of their mutual affection&mdash;disputes with Trolliet&mdash;longing
for agreement in doctrine regarding the Communion and Election.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>28th November 1552.</i>
</p>

<p>Nothing could have come to me more seasonably at this
time than your letter, which I received two months after its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
despatch. For, in addition to the very great troubles with
which I am so sorely consumed, there is almost no day on
which some new pain or anxiety does not occur. I should,
therefore, be in a short time entirely overcome by the load of
evils under which I am oppressed, did not the Lord by his own
means alleviate their severity; among which it was no slight
consolation to me to know that you are enjoying tolerable
health, such at least as your years admit of and the delicate
state of your body, and to be informed, by your own letter, that
your affection for me had undergone no change. It was reported
to me that you had been so displeased by a rather free
admonition of mine&mdash;which, however, ought to have affected
you far otherwise&mdash;that you tore the letter to pieces in the
presence of certain witnesses. But even if the messenger was
not sufficiently trustworthy, still, after a long lapse of time,
his fidelity was established by various proofs, and I was compelled
at length to suspect something. Wherefore I have
learned the more gladly that up to this time our friendship
remains safe, which assuredly, as it grew out of a heartfelt love
of piety, ought to remain for ever sacred and inviolable. But
it greatly concerns us to cherish faithfully and constantly to
the end the friendship which God has sanctified by the authority
of his own name, seeing that herein is involved either great
advantage or great loss even to the whole Church. For you
see how the eyes of many are turned upon us, so that the
wicked take occasion from our dissensions to speak evil, and
the weak are only perplexed by our unintelligible disputations.
Nor, in truth, is it of little importance to prevent the suspicion
of any difference having arisen between us from being handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
down in any way to posterity; for it is worse than absurd that
parties should be found disagreeing on the very principles, after
we have been compelled to make our departure from the world.
I know and confess, moreover, that we occupy widely different
positions; still, because I am not ignorant of the place in his
theatre to which God has elevated me, there is no reason for
my concealing that our friendship could not be interrupted
without great injury to the Church. And that we may act
independent of the conduct of others, reflect, from your own
feeling of the thing, how painful it would be for me to be
estranged from that man whom I both love and esteem above all
others, and whom God has not only nobly adorned with remarkable
gifts in order to make him distinguished in the eyes of the
whole Church, but has also employed as his chief minister
for conducting matters of the highest importance. And surely
it is indicative of a marvellous and monstrous insensibility, that
we so readily set at nought that sacred unanimity, by which
we ought to be bringing back into the world the angels of
heaven. Meanwhile, Satan is busy scattering here and there
the seeds of discord, and our folly is made to supply much
material. At length he has discovered fans of his own, for
fanning into a flame the fires of discord. I shall refer to what
happened to us in this Church, causing extreme pain to all the
godly; and now a whole year has elapsed since we were engaged
in these conflicts. Certain worthless wretches, after
stirring up strife amongst us, in reference to the free election of
God, and the sad bondage of the human will, and after creating
a public disturbance, had nothing more plausible to urge in
defence of their grievous opposition than the authority of your
name.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> And after they had found out how easy it was for us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
to refute whatever arguments they adduced, they tried to crush
us, forsooth, by this artifice,&mdash;by asking, if we were willing
openly to disagree with you. And yet, such was the moderation
observed by us, that least of all did they extort what they
were adroitly seeking to obtain. Therefore, all my colleagues
and myself openly professed to hold the same opinion on that
doctrine which you hold. Not a word escaped us, in the
whole discussion, either less honourable towards yourself than
was seemly, or calculated to diminish confidence in you.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
Meanwhile, nevertheless, such indefinite and reserved expression
of opinion cannot but pain me exceedingly; and it cannot
but pain me, that opportunity is being left to the evil-disposed
for harassing the Church, after our death, as often as
they please; while the conflicting parties will array against
each other the opinions of those who ought to have spoken, as
with one mouth, one and the same thing. It is neither surprising,
nor a thing greatly to be lamented, that Osiander has
withdrawn himself from us; yet he withdrew only after a violent
attack. For you were long ago aware that he belonged
to that race of wild animals which are never tamed; and I
always ranked him amongst the number of those who were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
disgrace to us. And assuredly, the very first day that I saw
him, I abhorred the wicked disposition and abominable manners
of the man. As often as he felt inclined to praise the
agreeable and excellent wine, he had these words in his mouth:
"I am that I am;" also, "This is the Son of the living God;"
which he manifestly produced as mockeries of the Deity.
Wherefore, I have the more frequently wondered that such a
despicable person should at all be encouraged by your indulgence.
In truth, I was particularly astonished on reading a
passage in a certain preface of yours, where, after the proof of
his folly at Worms, you commended him rather more than
enough. But let him retire: it is an advantage to us to have
got rid of him. I had rather that certain others were retained.
Nevertheless,&mdash;to pass by these also,&mdash;the opposition,
which is too plainly manifest in our modes of teaching, pains
me not a little. I, for my part, am well aware that, if any
weight is due to the authority of men, it were far more just
that I should subscribe your opinions than you mine. But
that is not the question; nor is it even a thing to be desired
by the pious ministers of Christ. This, in all truth, we ought
both to seek, viz., to come to an agreement on the pure truth
of God. But, to speak candidly, religious scruples prevent
me from agreeing with you on this point of doctrine, for you
appear to discuss the freedom of the will in too philosophical
a manner; and in treating of the doctrine of election, you
seem to have no other purpose, save that you may suit yourself
to the common feeling of mankind. And it cannot be
attributed to hallucination, that you, a man acute and wise,
and deeply versed in Scripture, confound the election of God
with his promises, which are universal. For nothing is
more certain than that the Gospel is addressed to all promiscuously,
but that the Spirit of faith is bestowed on the elect
alone, by peculiar privilege. The promises are universal.
How does it happen, therefore, that their efficacy is not equally
felt by all? For this reason, because God does not reveal his
arm to all. Indeed, among men but moderately skilled in
Scripture, this subject needs not to be discussed, seeing that
the promises of the Gospel make offer of the grace of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
equally to all; and God, by the external call, invites all who
are willing to accept of salvation. Faith, also, is a special
gift. I think I have clearly expounded this whole question,
involved and intricate though it be, in a book but very lately
published. Indeed, the matter is so obvious, that no one of
sound judgment can feel persuaded otherwise, than that you
are giving out what is quite different from your real inclination.
It increases my anxiety, and at the same time my grief,
to see you in this matter to be almost unlike yourself; for I
heard, when the whole formula of the agreement of our Church
with that of Zurich was laid before you, you instantly seized
a pen and erased that sentence which cautiously and prudently
makes a distinction between the elect and the reprobate.
Which procedure, taking into consideration the mildness of
your disposition, not to mention other characteristics, greatly
shocked me. Accordingly, I do not ask you to endure the
reading of my book, or even a part of it, because I think it
would be useless to do so. Would that we might have an
opportunity of talking over these matters face to face! I am
not ignorant of your candour, of your transparent openness
and moderation; as for your piety, it is manifest to angels
and to the whole world. Therefore, this whole question would
be easily, as I hope, arranged between us; wherefore, if an
opportunity should present itself, I would desire nothing more
than to pay you a visit. But if it shall indeed turn out as
you apprehend, it will be no slight comfort to me in circumstances
sad and grievous, to see you and embrace you before
that I shall take my departure from this world. Here we
enjoy least of all that repose which you fancy we enjoy.
There is much trouble, annoyance, and even disorder, among
us. Full in view is the enemy, who are continually imperilling
our lives by new dangers. We are at a distance of three
days' journey from Burgundy. The French forces are but an
hour's march from our gates. But because nothing is more
blessed than to fight under the banner of Christ, there is no
reason why these obstacles should prevent you from paying
me a visit. Meanwhile, you will greatly oblige me by informing
me of your own and the Churches' condition.&mdash;Adieu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
most distinguished sir and heartily esteemed brother. May
the Lord protect you by his power, guide you by his Spirit,
and bless your pious labours. My colleague, and many pious
and judicious men, reverently salute you.</p>

<h3>Rupture of Calvin with that Seigneur.</h3>


<p class="sig">
[<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, 1552.]
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,&mdash;Since you esteem your cause with respect
to me so good, I shall not add to your satisfaction by avowing
myself in the wrong, which indeed would be mere hypocrisy
on my part. For I know that I myself had already long
ago pointed out to you the conduct of the man, and his acts
are moreover matter of public notoriety. Since that time
you have bestowed on him such eulogiums, that the person
who recited them to me employed these words, that he had
never heard of a man held in such esteem. When you went
such lengths, after having been duly informed by me, your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
object in extolling him so highly must have been to have us
and our whole doctrine condemned; of which, he has shewn
himself so deadly, so furious, and so diabolical an enemy, that
he has not blushed to write:&mdash;The God of Calvin is hypocritical,
mendacious, perfidious, unjust, the provoker and
patron of crimes, and worse than the Devil himself. Thus
then, that I may express my opinion of you frankly, I ought
to renounce God and his truth, as well as the salvation which
I hope for through it. Such I believe, is not your intention,
but, if from the humanity and mildness of your disposition,
you are content not only to remain ignorant of the character
of the man who makes war on God, but also, by lending no
credit to our testimony, you furnish a handle for rendering us
odious, suffer me, I entreat you, to have some zeal in maintaining
the honour of my Master. But you will say, that I
should at least have given you some intimation of the affair.
I reply that after having been thus obliquely disgraced by you,
I wished to guard against exposing myself to derision. If ten
hours earlier I had been made aware of the words which I
have quoted, I should have contented myself with letting you
know what I had on my heart. As it chanced, your friend
immediately after, or the following day, asked me if I had
seen you. I replied that I had, and that I was sorry for it, and
I added that were you to pass a hundred times, I should avoid
all contact with you more carefully than with the most avowed
enemies, since in showing yourself so intimate with that man,
you were, as I have since been informed, the panegyrist of
Castalio,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> who is so perverse with all kinds of impiety, that
in truth I had a hundred times rather be a Papist. Your
friend then asked me if I had any objections to your being
informed of that. I replied that it was with that intention
that I had spoken to him on the subject, since I had not been
made aware of the fact sufficiently in time. If he has divulged
more than that, he has acted contrary to my opinion, my
wishes, and even his own promise. To have told you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
you were quite infected with the errors of that monster, was
running counter to the ends I had in view, for I told him that
you must needs have hated us gratuitously, to praise in our
despite such a monster. The substance of what I said was
that I should have been more painfully affected by such an
injury coming from any other than you, such was the confidence
I had in your integrity; but I was still more sorry to
see you adhering, not knowing for what reason, to a person
who is more detestable than all the Papists in the world. And
in fact, I said to him several times, that I knew not how, nor
wherefore, nor, indeed, what that meant. And since even at
this present moment you love to follow a lesson quite opposed
to that which I have learned in the school of my Master, for
you say that you are well-pleased to forget the evil which may
be in him; and yet we are told: Behold dogs, observe, mark,
shun, and beware of them.... I leave you the object
of your affections!&mdash;If I have been too sharp and bitter, pardon
me, you have obliged me to be so. And that you may
know that I feel neither anger nor ill-will, I write to you the
present letter, as one who is preparing to appear before God,
who afflicts me anew with an evil which is for me as it were
a mirror of death before my eyes. I will supplicate him,
Monseigneur, that in having pity on me, and receiving me to
his mercy, he may preserve and guide you by his Spirit, and
increase you in all prosperity along with Mademoiselle and
your whole family.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Your servant,</p>

<h3>Exhortation to patience and constancy under persecution.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>The 10th of January 1553.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Although I have not at present
to sustain the like conflicts that you have, yet you will suffer
the word of exhortation from me as if I were your fellow-prisoner,
and in truth the zeal which moves me to write to you
proceeds from nothing else. Yet I pray you to consider how
we ought to refer all to the will and disposal of our heavenly
Father, who calls every one of us in the order that he pleases.
Sometimes he spares his children, until he has gradually led
and prepared them, as we hear it said to St. Peter by the
Master's own lips, "When thou shalt be old, they shall carry
thee whither thou wouldst not." But it sometimes happens
that he chooses novices, or at least such as have not been
long disciplined to warfare. However that may be, there is
this advantage that he is no less powerful to put forth his
strength in the weak, rendering them at once invincible, than to
continue it to those who have long experienced it. From what I
hear, you have not been one of the first called to his knowledge;
yet God has nevertheless put you among the foremost of his
witnesses. He has bestowed such strength and steadfastness
upon you at the first assault, that the enemies of truth have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
taken knowledge of the mark of Jesus Christ, which they cannot
bear. I feel indeed by the sympathy I have for you (as I
ought) that Satan ceases not to give you new alarms; but you
must have recourse to Him who has made so good a beginning,
praying him to complete his own work. If you have many
trials, do not be greatly amazed on that account, even although
you feel such frailty in yourself that you are almost ready to be
shaken. Rather learn that it is by such means that God
would humble you, that his help should be the better recognized
by your need of it; and, moreover, that he invites you
to call on his name, and to have all dependence on his grace,
seeing there is need that we be forcibly driven to do so. I
doubt not but that there may also be firebrands from without,
who, under cover of friendship and relationship, will prove
your worst and most mortal enemies, since to save the body
they will do their utmost to draw the soul downward to perdition.
And then, men's fancy is a marvellous workshop for
forging out foolish imaginations, which disturb the true rest
which we ought to have in the holy calling of our God, who
commands us to look simply to himself, as indeed we have very
good reason to do. Therefore we have need to be armed and
accoutred at every point. But you need not be daunted,
seeing that God has promised to equip his own according as
they are assaulted by Satan. Only commit yourself to him,
distrusting all in yourself, and hope that he only will suffice
to sustain you. Further you have to take heed chiefly to
two things: first, what the side is you defend, and next, what
crown is promised to those who continue steadfast in the
Gospel. The service of God, the boundless grace which he
has manifested to us in his Son, and all the glory of his
kingdom, are such precious things, that no mortal man ought
to think it hard to spend his life in fighting against the base
corruptions, whose reign throughout the world tends to bring
to nought those blessings. And then, we know what will be
the end of our warfare, and that He who has bought us will
never suffer so dear a price as his blood to be lost, if we be but
signed with it. Now we know how he owns as his own, and
declares solemnly that he will own at the last day, all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
who have confessed him here below. We do not know as yet
what he has determined to do concerning you, but there is
nothing better for you than to sacrifice your life to him, being
ready to part with it whenever he wills, and yet hoping that he
will preserve it, in so far as he knows it to be profitable for
your salvation. And although this be difficult to the flesh, yet
it is the true happiness of his faithful ones; and you must pray
that it may please this gracious God so to imprint it upon your
heart that it may never be effaced therefrom. For our part,
we also shall pray that he would make you feel his power, and
vouchsafe you the full assurance that you are under his keeping;
that he bridles the rage of your enemies, and in every
way manifests himself as your God and Father.</p>

<p>As I hear that our brother, Peter Berger,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> is in the same
prison with you, I beg you to greet him from me, and to give
him my letters as common to you both. Let us go forward,
until we have arrived at our goal&mdash;the being gathered together
into the everlasting kingdom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had forgotten one point, which is, that you should reply to
adversaries reverently and modestly, according to the measure
of faith God gives you. I say this because it is not given to
every one to dispute. Indeed the martyrs themselves were no
great scholars, nor subtile to enter upon profound disputations.
Thus humbling yourself under the guidance of the Spirit of
God, answer soberly, according to your knowledge, following
the rule of Scripture, "I have believed, therefore I speak." Yet
let not that hinder you from speaking frankly and plainly, in
the full persuasion that He who has promised to give you a
mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be
able to gainsay, will never fail you.</p>

<h2>CCCVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Christopher Fabri.</span></h2>

<h3>Congratulations on the subject of his approaching marriage&mdash;Calvin's regret that he
cannot be present at the ceremony.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>13th January 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>I am exceedingly glad that you are about to get married, not
only because it will be for your own private good, but also
because the brethren have considered it to be for the good of
the whole Church.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> And while I do not indeed know enough
of the lady, yet I confidently trust, from various conjectures, that
each of you will turn out according to our wishes. We have
good reason, therefore to congratulate you, and we feel thankful
to God in no ordinary degree. I should gladly have been
present at your marriage, had I not been detained at home by
the wickedness of those who cease not to bring destruction upon
themselves and the community by their madness.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> I have
good reason to call it madness, for they have never exhibited
more unbridled licentiousness. I shall say nothing of their
mischievous plots for the destruction of the faith, of their gross
contempt of God, of their impious conspiracies for the scattering
of the Church, of the foul Epicurism of their whole life; and
this, not because these are light evils, but because they are
not unknown to you. The entire Republic is at present in
disorder, and they are striving to root up the established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
order of things. Had your marriage been a month later, I
should have had more leisure. I cannot move a foot at present.
I have not been through the city-gates for a month past, not
even for recreation. Would that I had less ground for my
excuse. Assuredly the season of winter would not have
stood in my way. But we shall pray that your marriage may
come off well, the effects of which will be felt even here. I
would not have thought it labour lost to obtain a conversation
with our beloved Farel and your chief magistrate, at the expense
of the cold and irksomeness of a three days' journey.
But one consideration was sufficient for me, that you wished
me to discharge a duty which I was as willing to fulfil, as you
were earnest in desiring it. I hope to find it more convenient
to visit my friends on another occasion. Adieu, very dear
brother in the Lord. Farel will pardon me for not writing
him. Present my very kind regards to him. Louis, minister
of Veissy,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> left us lately; I see that his life has been a burden
to him for some time past, owing to protracted debility. John
Macard<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> supplies his place. We must have a quarrel with
Philip.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Salute Maturin and the rest of our friends earnestly
in my name. May the Lord watch over you and guide you
by his Spirit. Amen.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Calvin apologizes for silence, and enjoins him to use his influence with the King for
the advancement of the Gospel in England.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>13th Feb. 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>I have hitherto avoided writing you, most distinguished sir,
lest I should perhaps seem anxious to obtain what my own
inclinations did not prompt. For as the friendships of the
world are hollow, and ambition and deception everywhere prevail,
so that those who cultivate sincerity are exceedingly few,
it is absolutely necessary for us almost to regard all with suspicion
whose uprightness of character we have not thoroughly
tested. I have at length, however, found an exceedingly just
motive for writing you, inasmuch as I have now frequently
made bold to write to the King himself, and have never written
a single letter to you, which was not at all becoming, seeing
that it was owing to your influence (under the grace of God)
that myself and the other servants of Christ were permitted
access to him. And as for the past my excuse is easy, for I
was at the first afraid lest those whom I was writing to exhort
might have too little confidence in me, if I employed the service
of others in presenting my letters; and I was again disinclined
to give you any trouble, as no familiarity had passed between
us. If I have in any way offended you in this matter, attribute
it rather to my shyness than to my negligence. Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
indeed, it is now a long while ago, that having been led thereto
by the fame of your rare piety and excellent learning, I must
have worthily esteemed you. Moreover, this one reason is sufficient
to win for you the favour of all good men, viz., that
England has a king whom you have trained by your labour,
not only possessing very superior talents, but also a maturity of
moral excellence beyond his years, who is extending a hand to
the suffering&mdash;I should rather in fact say miserable&mdash;Church
of God in these very sad times. Certainly, having deemed you
worthy of this honour, the Lord has not only endeared you to
those who experience the present benefit of it, but to as many
as desire to see the Church of God re-established, or at least to
see her remains gathered together. If then I bear testimony
to that affection which I have so long cherished towards you
in silence, I am persuaded this expression of my regard will
not be unpleasant to you. And again, while you, in that
splendid position of yours, do not require the humble offices of
men like me, and I, in turn, content with my own poor state,
am averse to impose any burden on you of my own account,
let us nevertheless cherish towards each other a mutual goodwill
throughout this fleeting life, until we find its full enjoyment
in heaven. Let us meanwhile, with one accord, make it
our study to adorn the kingdom of Christ, and, as far as in us
lies, to extend and watch over it. For we see how numerous
are its open and malicious enemies, whose fury is already
kindled, and is growing greater day by day; and, on the other
hand, how few is the number of those who have lent their
name to the Gospel, how few are conscientiously labouring for
the advancement of the glory of God. We see how much coldness,
or rather how much indifference, there is among many
men of influence; in a word, how much deadness there is
throughout the world. And while I believe you will do so of
your own accord, and stand in no need at all of any foreign
stimulus, yet, with your accustomed good nature, I have no
doubt but that you will take in good part what I have laid
thus familiarly before you, and which it becomes every one of
us earnestly to call to mind. I have indeed particularly to request
of you, whenever at any time you think that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
most serene King could be cheered forward by my exhortations,
to advise me thereon, and, according to circumstances,
that you will not grudge me your opinion. Adieu, most excellent
and heartily esteemed sir. May the Lord guard you
by his protection, continue to guide you by his Spirit, and
bless your sacred labours.</p>

<h3>Exhortations to constancy&mdash;Mention of Oritz, the Inquisitor.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>7th March 1553.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Brethren</span>,&mdash;We have been for some days past in deeper
anxiety and sadness than ever, having heard of the resolve
taken by the enemies of the truth. When the gentleman you
wot of passed this way,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> while he was dining very hurriedly, to
avoid all delay, I drew up such a form of letters as seemed to
me expedient to write. God has given, both to you and all
his people, some further respite; we wait the event as it
shall please him to dispose it, always praying him to uphold
you, and not permit you to fall away; in short, to have you in
his keeping. I feel well assured that nothing shakes the firmness
which he has put within you. Doubtless, for a long time
past, you have meditated upon the last conflict which you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
have to sustain, if it be his good pleasure to lead you thereto,
and have even so fought hitherto that long practice has inured
you to fill up what remains. It cannot be but that you feel
some twinges of frailty; yet, be confident that He whose
service you are upon will so rule in your hearts by his Holy
Spirit, that his grace shall overcome all temptations. If he
has promised to strengthen with patience those who suffer
chastisement for their sins, how much less will he be found
wanting to those who maintain his quarrel,&mdash;those whom he
employs on so worthy a mission as being witnesses for his
truth! You must therefore keep this sentence in mind, that
<em>He who dwells in you is stronger than the world</em>. We who are
here shall do our duty in praying that he would glorify himself
more and more by your constancy, and that he may, by
the consolation of his Spirit, sweeten and endear all that is
bitter to the flesh, and so absorb your spirits in himself, that
in contemplating that heavenly crown, you may be ready without
regret to leave all that belongs to this world.</p>

<p>I have received a certain paper containing some very subtle
arguments of that unhappy animal Oritz,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> to prove that it is
allowable to make idols. I do not know whether it is you
who have sent it me, and whether you would have me to reply
to it. I have not thought it worth while to do so, because I
was in some doubt about it, and really I do believe that you
have no great need of it. But if you like you shall have an
answer to it by the first. There is one thing which I have to
request of you: you saw some time ago the letters of a paltry
mocker of God in this place, who does nothing but trouble
the Church, and has never ceased to deal in that trade for five
years past. I wish much that by the first, you would write a
word of warning to make known his malice, as there is really
no end to him. And this I beseech you, as you love the repose
of this Church, which is more teased than you can well
believe by internal foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>
<p>And now, my brethren, after having besought our good
Lord to have charge over you, to assist you in everything and
through everything, to make you taste by experience how
kind a Father he is, and how careful of the salvation of his
own, I pray to be remembered in your prayers.</p>

<h3>Recommendation of a French gentleman, a prisoner for the sake of the Gospel.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 12th March 1553</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,&mdash;Although I had a petition to make to you for myself,
I should not have the boldness to urge it, yet I think that you
will not take it amiss, that I should make a request for another,
when you are informed of the necessity which constrains me,
and the merits of the case, which commends itself to you not
less than to myself. It is, Sire, that there is a French gentleman
detained prisoner in Paris<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> on account of some intercepted
letter written by him to one of our friends, who was the king's
lieutenant in the town of Noyon (of which I am a native), and
retired to these parts;<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> added to which the said gentleman was
already held suspected in the matter of religion. And being a
man of some rank they kept an eye upon him, which has been
the occasion of his seizure. Now, if my testimony has any
weight with your Majesty, I can assure you, Sire, that he is as
right-minded a man as you could anywhere meet with, excelling
in all honour and virtue, endowed with graces which deserve
to be loved and valued, and above all, confirmed in the
fear of God. I know very well that this is great praise; but
did you know him, Sire, I have no doubt that you would form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
a like judgment, and discover that I do not exceed due measure.
Now, as he is beloved of all, both high and low, even of Monsieur
de Vendosme and other princes, there is nothing save the
cause of Jesus Christ on account of which he can be hated or
rejected, which cause is so dear to you, Sire, that I hope you
will not refuse to help him, if there be any means of doing so.
I am aware that your Majesty cannot aid, as might be wished,
all those who labour and are persecuted on account of the
Gospel. But should it be your good pleasure to exert yourself
for him of whom I treat, be assured, Sire, that in the person
of one man you will console many who are at present
greatly dismayed, while the foes of truth are fully intending
to triumph if they succeed. But not to be too troublesome to
your Majesty, I shall enter no further upon facts, which, if it
seem good to you, you can better learn from the statements
of the gentleman who delivers this. Only I beseech you, in
the name of God, with all possible affection, yea as eagerly as
I would on behalf of my own life, that it may please you to
grant this request, namely, to ask the King of France to let
him depart out of his country, together with his wife, also detained,
and with as much of his property as can be withdrawn.
In doing which you will not only lay me under obligation
more and more to pray God to prosper you, but an infinite
number of believers besides.</p>

<p>Sire, after having commended myself as humbly as I can to
your kind favour, I pray our good Lord to keep you under
his holy protection, and to govern you by his Spirit in all
prudence, uprightness, and strength of purpose, and to make
your crown to flourish more and more.&mdash;Your very humble
and obedient servitor,</p>

<h3>Serious illness and unexpected recovery of Farel&mdash;Calvin's joy.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>27th March 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>When I recently performed the last offices of a friend towards
you, as I indeed thought, I was desirous of escaping the remainder
of the grief which was incidental to your premature
death. I have suffered the punishment which I deserved for
my overhastiness. And would that I had been the only one
who suffered it. It made the thing worse, that I involved very
many good men in the same grief with myself. Consoled,
however, now by more joyful news, I am forgetting my folly
and disgrace. And it is certainly proper that this wonderful
goodness of God should absorb all cause for sorrow. Seeing
now that your disease has left you, you must endeavour gradually
to recover that vigour of mind which you exercised too
actively in the most trying conflicts, and to regain possession
of that strength of body which must needs be worn out and exhausted.
Since I have buried you before the time, may the
Lord grant that the Church may see you my survivor. My
own private comfort is joined with the public good of the
faithful in this prayer; for my warfare will be the shorter,
and I shall not be subjected to the pain of lamenting your
death. Yet I am not, in the meanwhile, averse, if it should so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
please God, to your life being so long lengthened out, as to
allow me ten years of labour. But let us now live so for
Christ, that we may be daily prepared to die for him; we
ought, while we have opportunity, to prepare for what will
befall us. Make it your sole study, in the meanwhile, to take
care of your health, that you may soon recover. My brother
will tell you better, orally, than I can here how many friends
salute you. Adieu, very worthy brother. May the Lord, who,
contrary to our expectation, has restored you to his Church,
cause you ever to triumph over Satan and the wicked. Much
health to your fellow-ministers and others.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<h3>Last steps in favour of the Prisoners of Lyons.</h3>

<span class="smcap">From the Hostellerie in Lausanne</span>,<br />

<i>28th March 1553</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear Messieurs and Brethren</span>,&mdash;I write you this
present letter in much haste, having only just arrived at the
town of Lausanne. The occasion of my writing is, that Messieurs
of Berne have written so warmly to the king, that if they
are ever to obtain anything from him, we hope this appeal may
be final. Now, the prisoners have signified that we are to
apply to you for the expenses of the journey. We pray you,
therefore, to consider and determine speedily what had best be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
done. If you have any fitter messenger to send to court, we
beg of you to repay him his travelling expenses from Berne to
Lyons. If you think that he ought to proceed further, be pleased
to enjoin that money be furnished him without delay. May
God of his infinite mercy prosper the despatch as we hope. I
have addressed you privately, according to their instructions,
and I believe that you will not object to be employed in an
affair of this kind. Whereupon, after having affectionately
commended myself to you, I beseech our gracious God to have
you in his holy keeping, to guide you by his Spirit, and to
make you prosperous.</p>

<p>
Your humble brother and sincere friend,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">John Calvin</span>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You can see the copies of the two letters which Messieurs
of Berne have written. It might, perhaps, have been desirable
that the first, dated the 15th March, should have been kept
back.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> But the thing is done. The remedy is good, inasmuch
as the latter is as full as could be desired. Having perused
the whole, we beg of you to forward them to the prisoners
aforesaid. Our brother, Peter Viret, commends himself most
heartily to you.</p>

<h3>He entreats his influence in favour of the person already recommended to the King.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>March 1553.</i>
</p>

<p>When I lately wrote to you my last letter<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>&mdash;which may not
perhaps be put into your hands until after you have received
the present one&mdash;nothing was farther from my mind than that
I should again trouble you so soon. An unexpected necessity
has arisen, however, which compels me, even before I have
penned a single friendly letter to you, to solicit you regarding
a matter of great importance. A certain man, of a noble
family, has been lately thrown into prison, whose kind heart and
generous nature render him still more worthy of commendation
for his virtues, than for the nobility of his descent. Thinking
there was no danger, he had written to a common friend,
who came among us as a voluntary exile when the royal prefect
was at Noyon, the town in which I was born. Owing to the
perfidy of the messenger, the letter was seized. He was arrested
by a royal order. The Chancellor, and some others, were
appointed judges extraordinary. Seeing that this occurrence
has caused many good men to be seized with no ordinary
alarm, and that the enemies of the whole Church are ferociously
insulting Christ in the person of a man of sincere piety, it is
our duty to do all we can to restrain their fury, and bring
relief to such a distinguished servant of God. I was not at all
afraid, therefore, of any one accusing me of indiscretion in engaging
in the pious duty of commending the life of this person
to your most serene king. And the same necessity which drove
me to this, leads me to exhort you to use your interest, as far
as may be lawful, for furthering the end of my petition. And
while I am confident that you will be glad to do it of your own
accord, I nevertheless ask and beseech of you, most earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
to do it for my sake all the more speedily. Adieu, most distinguished
sir, deserving in many ways of my hearty reverence.</p>

<h3>Christian encouragement and consolation.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>12th April 1553.</i>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;I doubt not that you are at present in very
great perplexity, seeing that the rage of the enemies is daily
kindling, and dangers increasing more and more. Thus you
have much need to have recourse to Him who not in vain
claims the office of comforting his people in their afflictions.
Although it may be difficult to the weakness of our flesh to
continue steadfast when we see no end of warfare; nay more,
see that things grow worse; yet when girt about with the armour
which God bestows upon us, we must not fear but that we
shall overcome all the devices of Satan. I call "the armour
of God," not merely the promises and holy exhortations by
which he strengthens us, but the prayers which are to obtain
the strength we need. And therefore, sir, according to your
necessity, get by heart what Scripture sets before us, both as to
the present condition of Christians, and the miseries to which
they must needs be subject, and also as to the happy and desirable
issue promised them; and how, moreover, they shall never
be forsaken in the time of their need. I know&mdash;long continued
maladies being the most harassing&mdash;that it is extremely hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
for you to languish for such a length of time. But if the
enemies of the truth are thus obstinate in their fury, we ought
to be ashamed of not being at least equally steadfast in well-doing;
and most of all when it concerns the glory of our God
and Redeemer, which, of his infinite goodness, he has bound
up with our salvation. And I have no doubt that you put in
practice what the Apostle tells you about strengthening the
feeble knees, and lifting up the hands which hang down. For
it cannot be but that the first blows dismay, unless we rouse
our virtue to resist temptation. And as I feel well persuaded
that you are not slack in bestirring yourself, I am the more
brief. It is enough for me to have given you a few words of
advice, and at the same time to assure you that you are not
forgotten here, but that knowing the difficulties by which you
are beset, we have a fellow-feeling of them. I do not mean to
say that it is such as we ought to have, but it is at least the
testimony of the true brotherly love which we are bound to
bear you. Moreover, while praying God that he would
strengthen your courage and impart his protection, you will
also have to request that he would guide you with his advice,
and give you a favourable opening. However scant the means
he may offer you, you are free, as I believe, to use them,
and that speedily, lest they escape you. As for the road
which would be best for you to take, I know not what to say.
Although I should be very glad to see you, and to enjoy your
good-fellowship, yet I should not repine, knowing that in
order to follow after God, and to be the more drawn to him,
were you removed to twice the distance from me. I do not
know the advantages of the other place. As for ours, I must
not conceal from you that they are so scanty I am ashamed to
mention them. I wish much, and it would be desirable, that
there had been wherewithal to have drawn you hither. But I
ought not to inveigle you by vain expectations, having no other
desire than your wellbeing wherever it may be. True it is, that
what some promise themselves in retiring hither, rests, as
appears to me, on very slender grounds. However, there is
this to be said, the Christians here have liberty to worship
God purely, which is the chief point of all. For the present, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
must commit yourself to Him who has the spirit of prudence,
to be guided by him. Wherefore, in concluding, Monsieur,
after having affectionately commended me to your kind favour
and prayers, I pray our good Lord to increase you with the
gifts of his Spirit, to uphold you with his strong arm that you
faint not, to bridle Satan and all his underlings, so that they
may not be able to do aught against you, to glorify his name
by you even to the end. I desire also that Madame may have
her share in these commendations. And should an occasion
offer, I especially entreat you to present the like also to Madame,
your neighbour.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Once more, I pray the gracious Father to
have you all under his care, not merely for the preservation of
the body, but also for the keeping the soul unpolluted. Your
brother and humble servitor,</p>

<h3>Extinction of all hope in regard to the prisoners of Lyons.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>22d April 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>When the present messenger left Lyons matters stood thus:
the majority of the judges were disinclined to agree to the
condemnation of the brethren, inasmuch as the king had
given no express orders respecting it. The Constable, however,
stood alone in opposing this.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Good men thought accordingly
that something would require to be done. To me indeed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
labour appears not only useless, but absurd. For there is no
hope of inducing the Bernese, after their insolent repulse, to
expose themselves to no purpose to the mockery of the tyrant
and his court. Nor in truth would the Lyonnese ask aught of
the kind from us, if a copy of a letter which I received three
days ago were put into their hands. Should you deem it
advisable, you may counsel some of your Bernese friends as to
what should be done there. But good men will understand
from our letter that they need give themselves no farther
trouble. Adieu, very excellent and upright brother, together
with your wife and family. Salute Beza, your colleague Ribet,
and the rest of my friends. May Christ ever watch over you

<h3>Assurances of respect and fraternal affection.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>April 1553.</i>
</p>

<p>A letter was shown me lately at Farel's, addressed to himself,
in which you informed him that you were gradually recovering
from a very severe and all but fatal illness. The life
of our brother Farel was at that time despaired of; so much so,
that on my return, I declared everywhere that he was dead.
We have now to offer our sincere thanks to the Lord, who has
restored both of you to us and to his Church. I was very glad
to find from your letter, three days ago, that you are quite recovered.
Although, to speak the truth, the reading of it would
have filled me with more joy, had I not ascertained that it was
written to prevent me from entertaining any hostility towards
you. Certainly such a thing never entered my mind; nor do I
think that Ulmius had any reason for saying so. He came
twice to me. We conversed together for a long time on various
matters, freely and familiarly. Mention was made of yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
and the whole of your colleagues, but not a syllable escaped
me, so far as I know, calculated to convey an unfavourable
opinion of you. On desiring him, however, as he was leaving
me, to present my regards to you, I omitted Bibliander, inasmuch
as he was openly professing hostility towards us.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> When
Ulmius<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> seemed to regard this with incredulity, and turned
away from it as if from an unlucky omen, I briefly explained
to him the cause of it:&mdash;that having been tormented here by a
vile and perfidious character, I led myself to think that we
were sure of support from you; that the issue was not what I
had expected; that, notwithstanding, our brotherly regard for
one another remained unchanged, and no token, certainly, of
alienation had been given by you. I added, moreover, that
myself and my fellow-ministers, while we had not been so fully
supported by you as we could have wished, were nevertheless
inclined to put a favourable construction on it. Also, that
Bibliander was throwing out threats about being engaged on a
work against my doctrine, and that he went babbling about
concerning it, in some violent way or other, among all without
distinction. Our conversation at length concluded, by my
saying,&mdash;"Bibliander may write what he chooses; I shall not
consider him worthy of a reply."</p>

<p>But, to return to yourself, most excellent and venerable
brother, as I would be very far indeed from estimating you by
the character of that man, so I was never led to believe that
you entertained any hostility towards me whether publicly or
privately. If that individual kept up a great deal of offensive
babbling, and was, as I have said, boasting about his book,
there was really no reason why I should disguise the matter, or
make any hesitation about it, for the thing was notorious; and
while I am accustomed to say nothing about it to others, I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
not think that I required to be silent on it to Ulmius and a
select few. This, therefore, I have in the first place to testify
to you&mdash;and I solemnly declare it&mdash;that, so far am I from regarding
you as an enemy, I desire to remain bound to you for
ever by all ties of brotherly attachment; and, confidently
assured that it will be so, I hail you in no other manner than as
a loving and inseparable companion in the work of the Lord.
In the next place, I wish you to believe that I never either
wrote or spoke anything but what was loving and honourable
of that man who has publicly earned so much distinction in
the Church, and has been ever my friend in private. If, therefore,
you have been vexed at all by this matter, let your mind
be hereafter at ease.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<h3>He exhorts them to steadfastness unto the end, in the assurance of eternal joy reserved
in heaven.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>May 15, 1553</i>.
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Brothers</span>,&mdash;We have at length heard why
the herald of Berne did not return that way. It was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
he had not such an answer as we much desired. For the King
has peremptorily refused all the requests made by Messieurs
of Berne, as you will see by the copies of the letters, so that
nothing further is to be looked for from that quarter. Nay,
wherever we look here below, God has stopped the way. This
is well, however, that we cannot be frustrated of the hope
which we have in him, and in his holy promises. You have
always been settled on that sure foundation, even when it
seemed as though you might be helped by men, and that we
too thought so; but whatever prospect of escape you may have
had by human means, yet your eyes have never been dazzled
so as to divert your heart and trust, either on this side or that.
Now, at this present hour, necessity itself exhorts you more
than ever to turn your whole mind heavenward. As yet, we
know not what will be the event. But since it appears as
though God would use your blood to sign his truth, there is
nothing better than for you to prepare yourselves to that end,
beseeching him so to subdue you to his good pleasure, that
nothing may hinder you from following whithersoever he shall
call. For you know, my brothers, that it behoves us to be thus
mortified, in order to be offered to him in sacrifice. It cannot
be but that you sustain hard conflicts, in order that what was
declared to Peter may be accomplished in you, namely, that
they shall carry you whither ye would not. You know, however,
in what strength you have to fight&mdash;a strength on which
all those who trust, shall never be daunted, much less confounded.
Even so, my brothers, be confident that you shall
be strengthened, according to your need, by the Spirit of our
Lord Jesus, so that you shall not faint under the load of temptations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
however heavy it be, any more than he did who won
so glorious a victory, that in the midst of our miseries it is
an unfailing pledge of our triumph. Since it pleases him to
employ you to the death in maintaining his quarrel, he will
strengthen your hands in the fight, and will not suffer a single
drop of your blood to be spent in vain. And though the fruit
may not all at once appear, yet in time it shall spring up more
abundantly than we can express. But as he hath vouchsafed
you this privilege, that your bonds have been renowned, and
that the noise of them has been everywhere spread abroad, it
must needs be, in despite of Satan, that your death should resound
far more powerfully, so that the name of our Lord be
magnified thereby. For my part, I have no doubt, if it please
this kind Father to take you unto himself, that he has preserved
you hitherto, in order that your long-continued imprisonment
might serve as a preparation for the better awakening
of those whom he has determined to edify by your end.
For let enemies do their utmost, they never shall be able to
bury out of sight that light which God has made to shine in
you, in order to be contemplated from afar.</p>

<p>I shall not console, nor exhort you more at length, knowing
that our heavenly Father gives you to experience how precious
his consolations are, and that you are sufficiently careful to
meditate upon what he sets before you in his word. He has
already so shown how his Spirit dwells in you, that we are
well assured that he will perfect you to the end. That in leaving
this world we do not go away at a venture, you know not
only from the certainty you have, that there is a heavenly life,
but also because from being assured of the gratuitous adoption
of our God, you go thither as to your inheritance. That God
should have appointed you his Son's martyrs, is a token to you
of superabounding grace. There now remains the conflict, to
which the Spirit of God not only exhorts us to go, but even to
run. It is indeed a hard and grievous trial, to see the pride of
the enemies of truth so enormous, without its getting any
check from on high; their rage so unbridled, without God's interfering
for the relief of his people. But if we remember
that, when it is said that our life is hid, and that we must resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the dead, this is not a doctrine for any particular time,
but for all times, we shall not think it strange that afflictions
should continue. While it pleases God to give his enemies
the rein, our duty is to be quiet, although the time of our redemption
tarries. Moreover, if he hath promised to be the
judge of those who have brought his people under thraldom,
we need not doubt that he has a horrible punishment prepared
for such as have despised his majesty with such enormous
pride, and have cruelly persecuted those who call purely upon
his name. Put in practice, then, my brethren, that precept of
David's, and forget not the law of God, although your life may
be in your hands to be parted with at any hour. And seeing
that he employs your life in so worthy a cause as is the witness
of the Gospel, doubt not that it must be precious to him. The
time draws nigh when the earth shall disclose the blood which
has been hid, and we, after having been disencumbered of these
fading bodies, shall be completely restored. However, be the
Son of God glorified by our shame, and let us be content with
this sure testimony, that though we are persecuted and blamed
we trust in the living God. In this we have wherewith to
despise the whole world with its pride, till we be gathered
into that everlasting kingdom, where we shall fully enjoy those
blessings, which we now only possess in hope.</p>

<p>My brethren, after having humbly besought your remembrance
of me in your prayers, I pray our good Lord to have
you in his holy protection, to strengthen you more and more
by his power, to make you feel what care he takes of your
salvation, to increase in you the gifts of his Spirit, and to make
them subserve his glory unto the end.</p>

<h3>Expression of Christian sympathy under trial.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 7th of June 1553.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madame</span>,&mdash;Although I am not so devoid of compassion as
not to feel my heart pained, in hearing of the more than ever
strict captivity in which you are now held, yet I shall not cease
to exhort you to furnish yourself with courage and constancy,
according as you feel the trial to be vexatious and hard to bear;
for it is just when pressed by Satan and the enemies of the
faith to the uttermost, that we ought to make the most of the
grace of God. St. Paul glories in this, that although he was
chained in prison, nevertheless, the doctrine which he preached
was not bound, but having its course, and thriving powerfully.
And, indeed, seeing that it is the truth of God which reaches
far beyond this world, and upward above the heavens, it is not
likely that she should straiten herself according to the fancy
or by the tyranny of men. Consequently, the more the devil
contrives to torture us by distress, let us strive the more to
enlarge our hearts by faith, so as to meet all assaults. Our
Saviour, moreover, has formerly afforded you examples of the
kind, and gives us all the like daily in divers places; so that
we ought to take great shame to ourselves if we are not strengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
by them. For were we to grow faint under the strokes
of the rod, when others are noways dismayed by death, what
excuse should we have for our cowardice? You had not
counted on the possibility of meeting with such rude conflicts
at home. But you know how the Son of God forewarns us,
so that nothing should trouble us, seeing that we have been
prepared for it beforehand. Think, rather, that this is not the
end, but that God is trying you very gently, supporting your
weakness, until you have more strength to sustain blows. But
be this as it may, beware of letting yourself be cast down by
indifference or despair. Many are overcome, because they
allow their zeal to grow cold, and run off in self-flattery.
Others, on the contrary, become so alarmed when they do not
find in themselves the strength they wish, that they get confused,
and give up the struggle altogether. What then is to
be done? Arouse yourself to meditate, as much upon the
promises of God, which ought to serve as ladders to raise us
up to heaven, and make us despise this transitory and fading
life, as upon threatenings, which may well induce us to fear
his judgments. When you do not feel your heart moved as it
ought to be, have recourse, as to a special remedy, to diligently
seeking the aid of Him without whom we can do nothing. In
the meantime, strive to your utmost, blaming coldness and
weakness, until you can perceive that there is some amendment.
And in regard to this, great caution is required so as to hold
a middle course, namely, to groan unceasingly, and even to woo
yourself to sadness and dissatisfaction with your condition, and
to such a sense of misery as that you may have no rest; without,
at the same time, any doubting that God in due time will
strengthen you according to your need, although this may not
appear at once. It can be nothing strange to you to see the
poor Church of God so miserably afflicted&mdash;to see the pride of
enemies increase more and more with their cruelty. If your
mind is in too great perplexity, this it is that you should find
strange, as a proof of your having forgotten what we ought to
have rooted in the depths of our heart, the duty of conformity
to the image of the Son of God, patiently bearing the ignominy
of his cross, until the day of our triumph come. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
let not this hinder, but rather induce you to follow on in the
way, for we must yet be sifted even more thoroughly.</p>

<p>Had I heard, that, being deprived of the little liberty you
had, you did not cease to have your heart set aright, and
to persevere in the service of Him who merits well that his
honour be preferred to all beside, I should have whereof to
rejoice more fully. However, I do rejoice, whatever be the
result, in the good hope I have of this: therefore, do not
wrong me by disappointment. However, you must consider
most of all what you owe to our gracious God, and to the Lord
Jesus Christ, who has shown how dear we were to him, since
he has not spared himself for us; therefore, see to it that
Satan and his underlings, who have thought to trample your
faith beneath their feet, be confounded. But as so great a
victory requires greater strength than your own, take refuge in
this kind Lord Jesus, who has been made to us the strength of
God his Father, so that in him we might do all things. And
for my part, I shall beseech him that he would pour out upon
you the help of his Spirit, so that you may know by experience
what it is to be upheld by him, and that he may be glorified
thereby, praying also that he would take you into his holy
protection, against the fury of wolves, and the wiles of foxes.
Whereupon, Madame, after having humbly commended me to
your kind favour, likewise to your prayers, I shall now make
an end.</p>

<h3>He impresses on them the duty of maintaining their confession of the truth quietly
and modestly.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>This 7th of July 1553.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Brethren</span>,&mdash;I believe you have been informed that I was
absent from town when the tidings from your prison arrived,
and did not return for eight days after. I need not, therefore, to
excuse myself for having so long delayed writing to you. Now,
although these tidings have proved sorrowful to the flesh, even
in consequence of the love we justly bear you in God, as we are
bound to do, yet must we submit ourselves to the will of this kind
Father and sovereign Lord, and not only consider his way of
disposing of us just and reasonable, but also accept it with a
gentle and loving heart as altogether right and profitable for
our salvation,&mdash;patiently waiting until he palpably show it to
be so. Besides, we have whereof to rejoice even in the midst
of our sorrow, in that he has so powerfully aided you, for need
was that you should be strengthened by his Spirit, so that the
confession of his sacred truth should be more precious to you
than your own lives. We all know too well how difficult it
is for men to forget self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore it must needs be that our gracious God put forth
his strong arm; then, for the sake of glorifying him we do
not fear torments, nor shame, nor death itself. Now, since he
has girded you with his power, so as to sustain the first assault,
it remains to entreat him to strengthen you more and more
according to your further conflict. And seeing that he has
promised us victory in the end, do not doubt, that as he has
imparted a measure of his strength, so you will have more
ample evidence in future, that he does not make a beginning
only to leave his work imperfect, as it is said in the Psalm.
Especially when he puts such honour upon his people, as to
employ them in maintaining his truth, and leads them, as it
were by the hand, to martyrdom, he never leaves them unprovided
with the needful weapons. Yet, meanwhile, remember
to lift up your eyes to that everlasting kingdom of Jesus Christ,
and to think of whose cause it is in which you fight; for that
glance will not only make you overcome all temptations which
may spring from the infirmity of your flesh, but will also render
you invincible by all the wiles of Satan, whatever he may
devise to darken God's truth,&mdash;for I am well assured, that it
is by his grace you are so settled and grounded, that you do
not walk at a venture, but that you can say with that valiant
champion of Jesus Christ, I know on whom I have believed.</p>

<p>This is why I have not sent you such a confession of faith as
our good brother Peloquin asked me for, for God will render
that which he will enable you to make, according to the
measure of mind which he has allotted you, far more profitable
than any that might be suggested to you by others. Indeed,
having been requested by some of our brethren who have lately
shed their blood for the glory of God, to revise and correct the
confession they had prepared, I have felt very glad to have a
sight of it for my own edification, but I would neither add, nor
take away, a single word; believing that any change would but
lessen the authority and efficacy which the wisdom and constancy
we clearly see to have proceeded from the Spirit of God
deserved. Be then assured, that God who manifests himself in
time of need, and perfects his strength in our weakness, will not
leave you unprovided with that which will powerfully magnify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
his name. Only proceed therein with soberness and reverence,
knowing that God will no less accept the sacrifice which you
offer him, according to the measure of ability which you have
received from him, than if you comprehended all the revelations
of angels, and that he will make effectual that which he
puts into your mouth, as well to confirm his own, as to confound
the adversaries. And as you know that we have steadfastly
to withstand the abominations of the Papacy, unless we
would renounce the Son of God, who has purchased us to himself
at so dear a rate, meditate, likewise, on that celestial glory
and immortality to which we are invited, and are certain of
reaching through the Cross&mdash;through ignominy and death. It
is strange, indeed, to human reason, that the children of God
should be so surfeited with afflictions, while the wicked disport
themselves in delights; but even more so, that the slaves of Satan
should tread us under foot, as we say, and triumph over us. However,
we have wherewith to comfort ourselves in all our miseries,
looking for that happy issue which is promised to us, that he
will not only deliver us by his angels, but will himself wipe away
the tears from our eyes. And thus we have good right to despise
the pride of these poor blinded men, who to their own ruin lift
up their rage against heaven; and although we are not at present
in your condition, yet we do not on that account leave off
fighting together with you by prayer, by anxiety and tender
compassion, as fellow-members, seeing that it has pleased our
heavenly Father, of his infinite goodness, to unite us into one
body, under his Son, our head. Whereupon I shall beseech
him, that he would vouchsafe you this grace, that being stayed
upon him, you may in nowise waver, but rather grow in
strength; that he would keep you under his protection, and
give you such assurance of it, that you may be able to despise
all that is of the world. My brethren greet you very affectionately,
and so do many others.&mdash;Your brother,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">John Calvin</span>.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As this letter will, I hope, be in common to you both, I shall
merely add, that there is no need whatever for a long exhortation
from me; it is enough that I pray God that it may please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
him to impress still better and better upon your heart, what I
see by your letter, that you already enjoy. However grievous
it may be to pine so long, if you got no other benefit by it
than God's showing you that he has not reserved you until
now without cause, you have good reason not to grow faint nor
wearied out thereby. And as for the sickness, it is well for
you to consider, that God in this way wishes to prepare you
better for a greater conflict, so that the flesh being entirely subdued,
may be more able to resign itself. Thus we ought to
turn to profitable improvement everything that the heavenly
Father sends us. If you can communicate with the other brethren,
I pray you to salute them also from me. May God uphold
you all by his strong hand, preserve and guide you, and
make his own glory to shine forth in you more and more.</p>

<h3>Expression of regret for the death of the King of England&mdash;sad condition of the German
Churches.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>3d August 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>Paulus an Italian, and a man of tried integrity, on writing
lately to our friend Count Celso, stated, among other things,
that he had brought a letter for me from the very honourable the
Duchess of Ferrara, which he left with you. Seeing that I
received a letter from Gualter not long since, in which he
makes no mention of such a thing; and seeing, moreover, that
John Liner, a merchant of Saint Gall, on passing through this
place a short while before, alleged that you had written me
through a certain Jew, I am really suspicious that you have
been deceived by him. He was not seen by any one here; and
indeed I have no doubt but that he has betaken himself to one
who is likely to bring him greater gain. If it should turn out
accordingly that this letter has been lost, I am anxious that
the Duchess should be informed of it. Inasmuch, therefore, as
this nobleman, whom she has now employed for many years as
a messenger to the French king, was about to make a journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
thither, I have requested him to ask you whether anything
was done with the packet which Paulus left with you, in order
that he may inform his mistress of it.</p>

<p>The messengers regarding the death of the English king are
more numerous than I could wish.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> We are therefore mourning
him just as if we were already certain of his death, or
rather mourning over the fate of the Church, which has met
with an incalculable loss in the person of a single individual.
We are held at present in anxious suspense as to whether
matters are to go to confusion. It is meanwhile very greatly
to be lamented that Germany is being torn by intestine strife,
by wounds inflicted by each on the other. But it is nothing
wonderful that the Lord should employ violent remedies for
such hopeless diseases. All we can do is to pray earnestly and
unceasingly that he may not permit his Church to be utterly
overwhelmed, but rather that he may guide her safe through
the general wreck.</p>

<p>Adieu, most distinguished sir, and most revered brother in
Christ. Salute courteously your fellow-ministers, your wife,
your sons-in-law, and your daughters. May the Lord shield
you all by his protection and guide you by his Spirit. My

<h3>Arrest of Servetus, and institution of the process against him.</h3>

<p>It is as you say, my dear Farel. Although we may be severely
buffeted hither and thither by many tempests, yet, seeing that a
pilot steers the ship in which we sail, who will never allow us
to perish even in the midst of shipwrecks, there is no reason
why our minds should be overwhelmed with fear and overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
with weariness. We have now new business in hand with
Servetus. He intended perhaps passing through this city; for
it is not yet known with what design he came. But after he
had been recognized, I thought that he should be detained.
My friend Nicolas summoned him on a capital charge, offering
himself as security according to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex talionis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> On the following
day he adduced against him forty written charges. He at
first sought to evade them. Accordingly we were summoned.
He impudently reviled me, just as if he regarded me as obnoxious
to him. I answered him as he deserved. At length
the Senate pronounced all the charges proven. Nicolas was
released from prison on the third day, having given up my
brother as his surety; on the fourth day he was set free. Of
the man's effrontery I will say nothing; but such was his
madness that he did not hesitate to say that devils possessed
divinity; yea, that many gods were in individual devils, inasmuch
as deity had been substantially communicated to those,
equally with wood and stone. I hope that sentence of death
will at least be passed upon him; but I desire that the severity
of the punishment may be mitigated.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Adieu. My colleagues

<i>This 22d of August 1553</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear Brethren</span>,&mdash;Although when writing your letter
you thought that the enemies of truth were about to sacrifice
you soon, I do not omit writing to you, so that if it please
God that this should arrive in time, you may again have
some words of consolation from me. It is very well and
very prudently determined by you to give thanks to God, since
you know that he has confirmed you anew in his promises,
giving you such constancy as you have lately felt in your last
replies. It is indeed of him alone that you have remained
steadfast and unflinching. Hence I feel well assured that this
seal, which bears the true mark of the Holy Spirit, will never
be effaced. Elsewhere he has wrought so powerfully upon
Michael Girard,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> that his former weakness gives all the greater
lustre to the strength which he has received from above. I
have no doubt that even the enemies themselves must be convinced
that this change did not proceed from man. Consequently
there is stronger reason why we should have our eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
open to contemplate the hand of God which is here put forth
after a wondrous manner, to withdraw his frail creature from
the horrible confusion into which he had fallen. At the time
that he followed his own devices, he fancied that he had
gained much in redeeming for a short period this fading
miserable life, by plunging himself into the abysses of eternal
death. It is then a divine work, that of his own goodwill he
should have again returned to death, that he might attain to a
life of uprightness, from which he had not merely strayed, but
absolutely excluded himself as far as in him lay. For the
goodness of God has been the more richly displayed, by having
raised up his creature out of a fall which seemed fatal, yea, so
as even to triumph by it, and to magnify his glory, as he has
begun to do, and will I hope carry out to perfection.</p>

<p>I have seen the confession drawn up by him, which is pure
and frank, and worthy of a Christian man. Nevertheless, I
think it right that he should be warned as to some points, in
order that the adversaries may be the more confounded by his
making a more distinct reply;&mdash;not that what he says be not
true, but because the malignant always lay hold of the slightest
occasions to calumniate and pervert what is right.</p>

<p>On being questioned as to whether the body of Christ exist
not under the appearance of bread, he answered that this was
mere blasphemy, annihilating the death of Jesus Christ. Now
there were two things which he ought to have especially reproved
in the Mass: the one is idolatry, seeing that they make
an idol of a bit of bread, worshipping it as God; the other
that they make of it a sacrifice to reconcile men to God. Now
as Jesus Christ is the only priest ordained of God the Father,
so likewise has he offered himself once for all, and his death
is the sole and perpetual sacrifice for our redemption. Even
on the first head, it would have been well to protest his
belief, that in the Supper we communicate in the body and
blood of Jesus Christ, but that we do so by rising to heaven
through faith, and not by making him descend here below,
taking care to add, that this is no argument in favour of their
Mass, which is altogether opposed to the Supper of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>Being questioned as to whether the Virgin Mary and the
saints intercede for us, he answered, that there is but one only
intercessor and advocate, Jesus Christ; which is true, for there
are neither men nor angels who have access to God the Father
save by this Mediator alone. But it would have been well to
add, that the office of intercession is not bestowed upon the
dead, God commanding us to intercede, the one for the other,
in the present life: nevertheless, because it is not lawful to
pray to God except in assurance of faith, that nothing remains
for us but to call upon God in the name of Jesus Christ, and
that all those who seek to the Virgin Mary and the saints as
their advocates, act extravagantly, and turn aside out of the
way.</p>

<p>Being questioned as to free-will, in order to show that of ourselves
we have no power of well-doing, he alleges the expression
of Saint Paul in the 7th of the Romans: <em>The good that I
would, I do not</em>, &amp;c. Now it is certain, that Saint Paul does
not speak there of unbelievers who are wholly destitute of the
grace of God, but of himself and of other saints to whom God
had already given grace to aspire after well-doing. On such
points he confesses that he felt such a struggle within himself,
that he could not attain to a full performance of duty. Accordingly
this further statement should have been made: If the
faithful feel their whole nature opposed to the will of God,
what must be the case with those who are full of pure malice
and rebellion? Just as he says in the 8th chapter, that all
the affections of the flesh are only so much enmity against God.
And in Ephesians ii., he shows clearly what is in man. Item,
in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapters i. ii., and in
Romans iii.; whence it follows, that it is God who works in
us to will and to do, according to his good pleasure.</p>

<p>Being questioned concerning vows, he answered, that all our
promises are but lies. Now, it would have been well to specify
that a part of their vows being impossible, they are nothing
but an insult to God: as, for instance, when the monks and
priests renounce marriage; and that generally the whole of
these vows are nothing but false inventions in order to bastardize
the service of God, and that we are not permitted to promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
or offer to him except in accordance with his word. I believe
that the said brother will be well pleased to be informed of
these things, so that the truth of God may be the more victorious
in him.</p>

<p>For the rest, as in the midst of this life we are in death, you
have now need to be well persuaded that in the midst of death
you are in life. And thus we see that we must not be governed
by sense merely in following Jesus Christ, for there is nothing
more alien to our nature than to plunge ourselves into disgrace,
and abase ourselves unto death, in order to be elevated to the
glory of heaven. But in the end we shall feel, experimentally,
that the Son of God has not disappointed us in promising that
whosoever shall lay down his life in this world shall recover it
to enjoy it for ever. Wherefore, my brethren, if hitherto you
have known by experience the value of the consolations which
this kind Lord Jesus Christ vouchsafes to his own, to enable
them to welcome all that they suffer in his cause, and the
value of the help of his Spirit in giving them such courage
that they faint not, beseech him to continue both the one and
the other, and in so praying rest in him, assured that he will
fulfil your holy desire. On our part, while you are fighting,
we shall not forget you. All my brethren salute you. The
God of grace and Father of mercy have you under his protection;
and if it please him that you should endure death for
the testimony of his Gospel, as seems likely, may he show that
he has not forsaken you, but rather that while appointing you
his martyrs, he dwells and reigns within you, to triumph in
you to the confusion of his enemies, and the edification of the
faith of his elect; and may he lead us all until he gathers us
together into his kingdom.</p>

<h3>Request for the destruction of the copies at Frankfort of the book of Servetus.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>August 27, 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ, more peculiarly set apart, and my worshipful
brethren.</p>

<p>You have doubtless heard of the name of Servetus, a
Spaniard, who twenty years ago corrupted your Germany with
a virulent publication, filled with many pernicious errors. This
worthless fellow, after being driven out of Germany, and having
concealed himself in France under a fictitious name, lately
patched up a larger volume, partly from his former book,
and partly from new figments which he had invented. This
book he printed secretly at Vienne, a town in the neighbourhood
of Lyons. Many copies of it had been conveyed to
Frankfort for the Easter fairs: the printer's agent, however,
a pious and worthy man, on being informed that it
contained nothing but a farrago of errors, suppressed whatever
he had of it. It would take long to relate with how
many errors&mdash;yea, prodigious blasphemies against God&mdash;the
book abounds. Figure to yourselves a rhapsody patched up
from the impious ravings of all ages. There is no sort of
impiety which this monster has not raked up, as if from the
infernal regions. I had rather you should pass sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
on it from reading the book itself. You will certainly find on
almost every single page, what will inspire you with horror.
The author himself is held in prison by our magistrates, and
he will be punished ere long, I hope; but it is your duty to
see to it that this pestiferous poison does not spread farther.
The messenger will inform you respecting the number and the
repository of the books. The bookseller, if I mistake not, will
permit them to be burnt. Should anything stand in the way,
however, I trust that you will act so judiciously, as to purge
the world of such noxious corruptions. Besides, your way
will be clear,&mdash;because if the matter be submitted to your judgment,
there will be no necessity for asking the magistrate to
interfere. And while I am so persuaded of your integrity that
I believe it would be sufficient to inform you of it; yet the
magnitude of the affair demands that I should beseech you, by
Christ, faithfully to strive to discharge your duty, lest the
opportunity should slip from you.</p>

<p>Fare ye well, most honoured sirs, and very dear brethren.
May the Lord guide you by his Spirit, shield you by his protection,
and bless your labours.</p>

<h3>Troubles at Geneva&mdash;Berthelier and the chiefs of the Libertins are refused admission
to the Lord's Table.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>4th September 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>I was wishing to maintain silence towards you regarding our
affairs, that I might not augment your grief to no purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
But fearing that you might be more deeply affected by divers
rumours, I at length thought it better to inform you respecting
the principal point. When Berthelier, a year and a half ago,
was interdicted the privilege of the Supper, he complained to
the senate, and we, to please the scoundrel, were summoned
before their assembly. After having heard the case, the Senate
pronounced him to have been rightfully excommunicated.
Whether from despair or contempt, he has kept quiet ever
since up to the present time. Now, indeed, that the Syndicate
of Perrin might not become forgotten, he has wished the Senate
to restore him, without consulting the Consistory. On being
summoned a second time, I demonstrated, in a long speech, that
to do so would be to act, not only contrary to what was right,
but also contrary to law; nay more, that it was sinful to destroy
the discipline of the Church in this manner. During my
absence, however, and unknown to the Consistory, an opportunity
was afforded him of receiving the Supper. As soon as
I got notice of it, I used all my endeavours to get the Syndics
to call a meeting of the Senate. I have devoted myself so
earnestly to the cause, that, in my mind, nothing calculated to
influence their minds was left undone. I endeavoured, partly
by vehemence, and partly by moderation, to reduce them to a
sound mind. I even took an oath, that I had resolved rather
to meet death than profane so shamefully the holy Supper of
the Lord; for that nothing was more intolerable than that
that individual, mocking and insulting the Church of God by
his contumacy, should by raising the standard, so to speak,
incite the worst characters, and those like himself, to indulge
in the same effrontery. The reply was, that the Senate had
nothing to change in its former decision. From which you
perceive, that by this law my ministry is abandoned, if I suffer
the authority of the Consistory to be trampled upon, and extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
the Supper of Christ to open scoffers, who boast that pastors
are nothing to them. In truth, I should rather die a hundred
times, than subject Christ to such foul mockery. I need not
record what I said yesterday in both assemblies, as you will
get an oral account of it from many. The wicked and the
abandoned may now obtain, therefore, what they have eagerly
sought. The calamity to the Church grieves me, as indeed it
ought. But if God yields so much power to Satan, as to strip
me of the liberty of my ministry by his violent commands, I
am satisfied. Certainly, he who has inflicted the wound, will
himself find a remedy. And, indeed, seeing that so much
wickedness has now passed with impunity for many years, perhaps
the Lord is preparing some judgment which I am not
deemed worthy to see. In fine, whatever may happen, it is
our duty to submit to his will.</p>

<p>Farewell, most worthy brethren. May the Lord be ever
present with you, to guide and protect you. Pray him, on
the other hand, to look down upon this unfortunate Church.</p>

<h3>Deep anxiety on account of the condition of the English Churches&mdash;Conference of the
Swiss Churches in regard to Servetus.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>7th September 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>With respect to the letter, I had no doubt but that you made
a faithful endeavour, so far as it was your duty, to send it to
me in safety. That Jew has deceived you however; at least
he has not done what you expected of him. He at length
arrived here, but alleged that he had been robbed at Fribourg:
he could give no definite account of the letter. As circumstances
did not turn out here according to his wishes, he crossed
over to England. I informed him that matters were in a disturbed
state in that country, and endeavoured to deter him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
from his design. It was of no avail, however; but he may
take his own way.</p>

<p>We have good reason to feel anxiety&mdash;yea even torment&mdash;regarding
that nation [England].<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> What is to become of so
great a multitude of pious men, who have betaken themselves
to voluntary exile in that country?<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> There is danger, also,
that we shall hear very sad news ere long, of the many native
English who have already embraced Christ, if the Lord do not
in his mercy send help to them from heaven. Besides, the
same rumour is gathering strength here with respect to Cardinal
Pole.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Moreover, as, I have always heard that she is a
very haughty animal who now succeeds to the crown, and cruel
withal, there sometimes steals over me a prophetic conjecture,
that her audacity will carry her all lengths. You are aware
of the rash daring peculiar to her family. She will prove
troublesome to almost all parties in the long run. Should she
make a weak attempt to alter the existing constitution, she
will find opponents not a few. Meanwhile, the Church of God
will be in a manner buffeted by manifold tempests. Let us,
therefore, as you say, commend this very troubled state of
affairs to God.</p>

<p>Our Council will, on an early day, send the opinions of Servetus
to your city, to obtain your judgment regarding them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Indeed they cause you this trouble, despite our remonstrances;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
but they have reached such a pitch of folly and madness, that
they regard with suspicion whatever we say to them. So much
so, that were I to allege that it is clear at mid-day, they would
forthwith begin to doubt of it. Our brother Gualter [will tell
you] more;<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> for I am compelled to conclude, as there are
many here whom I found on returning home from dinner.</p>

<p>Adieu, therefore, most accomplished sir, and honourable
brother in the Lord. Salute your fellow-ministers, your sons-in-law,
and your whole family. May Christ preserve, guide,
and bless you all. Amen. My colleagues&mdash;all very dejected&mdash;salute
you earnestly.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Statement of the errors of Servetus, and of the duty of the Christian magistrate to
repress them.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>8th September 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>As Michael Servetus, twenty years ago, infected the Christian
world with his virulent and pestilential opinions, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
suppose his name is not unknown to you. While you may not
have read his book, yet you must have heard something of the
sort of doctrines contained in it. It was he whom that faithful
minister of Christ, Master Bucer of holy memory, in other
respects of a mild disposition, declared from the pulpit to be
worthy of having his bowels pulled out, and torn to pieces.
While he has not permitted any of his poison to go abroad since
that time, he has lately, however, brought out a larger volume,
printed secretly at Vienne, but patched up from the same
errors. To be sure, as soon as the thing became known, he was
cast into prison. He escaped from it some way or other, and
wandered in Italy for nearly four months. He at length, in an
evil hour, came to this place, when, at my instigation, one of
the Syndics ordered him to be conducted to prison. For I do
not disguise it, that I considered it my duty to put a check, so
far as I could, upon this most obstinate and ungovernable
man, that his contagion might not spread farther. We see
with what wantonness impiety is making progress everywhere,
so that new errors are ever and anon breaking forth: we see
how very inactive those are whom God has armed with the
sword, for the vindication of the glory of his name. Seeing
that the defenders of the Papacy are so bitter and bold in behalf
of their superstitions, that in their atrocious fury they shed
the blood of the innocent, it should shame Christian magistrates,
that in the protection of certain truth, they are entirely
destitute of spirit. I certainly confess that nothing would be
less becoming, than for us to imitate their furious intemperance.
But there is some ground for restraining the impious
from uttering whatever blasphemies they please with impunity,
when there is an opportunity of checking it. As respects this
man, three things require to be considered. With what prodigious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
errors he has corrupted the whole of religion; yea,
with what detestable mockeries he has endeavoured to destroy
all piety; with what abominable ravings he has obscured
Christianity, and razed to the very foundation all the principles
of our religion. Secondly, how obstinately he has behaved;
with what diabolical pride he has despised all advice;
with what desperate stubbornness he has driven headlong in
scattering his poison. Thirdly, with what proud scorn he at
present avows and defends his abominations. For so far is
he from any hope of repentance, that he does not hesitate to
fling this blot upon those holy men, Capito and &OElig;colampadius,
as if they were his companions. When the letters of
&OElig;colampadius were shown him, he said that he wondered by
what spirit they had been led away from their former opinion.
But as I hope you will see to it that the impiety of the man
be represented in the character it merits, I shall not add
more. Only there is one thing I wish to say to you, viz.,
that the treasurer of this city, who will deliver to you this
letter, takes a correct view of this case, so that he at least does
not avoid the issue which we desire. Would that your old
disciples were animated by the same spirit!<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>I write you nothing regarding French matters, as I do not
think there is anything new here, which is not equally known
among yourselves, except that there were three pious brethren
burnt at Lyons on Sabbath last; a fourth was sent to a neighbouring
town to suffer a similar fate.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> It is scarcely credible,
seeing that they were illiterate men, how they were, as far as it
appeared, enlightened by the Spirit of God to the highest perfection
of doctrine, and with what courage they were supported
to maintain an inflexible firmness. One at first, overcome by
fear, had swerved from a genuine confession. When the
judges resolved upon releasing him, he, having asked forgiveness
for his insincerity, eagerly offered himself to the flames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Similar fires are kindled, also, in other parts of France; nor is
there any hope of relief.&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<h3>He consoles her under her trials, and exhorts her to use every means to secure her
retreat to Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">From Geneva</span>, <i>this 13th September 1553</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle and very dear Sister</span>,&mdash;I am much grieved
by your affliction, not only because the children of God ought
to bear each other's burdens, but because I feel the cause for
which you suffer to be a common one; for, as I am told, they
afflict and detain you captive for having wished to follow Jesus
Christ. You have, however, whereof to rejoice in the good testimony
which your conscience renders you in the sight of God,
that you do not suffer on account of evil doing, but because
Satan cannot endure that you should break loose from the
bonds of the servitude in which you have hitherto pined.
Notwithstanding, you must call upon God, beseeching him to
have compassion upon you, and committing yourself entirely
into his hand, to hope for such deliverance as he shall please
to send you. Nevertheless, if there were any right and lawful
means of escaping out of the hands of him who detains you,
you should ask counsel from God, so that by his Spirit he
might teach you to take advantage of it. As I am not
thoroughly acquainted with the facts, nay, as I do not even know
your person nor your rank, I shall write upon the report of the
gentlemen who are the bearers of the present letter. They
have told me that as you were preparing to come hither, nay,
actually on your way, the thing being discovered, some priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
who is related to you, seized upon you, and now detains you as
in a prison, from whence you have no means of getting free,
unless you pretend to be willing for a while to live in that
neighbourhood. Now, they promise to harbour you in their
house, where you will be free to serve God purely, without mixing
yourself up with the idolatries which prevail throughout
the country. Before giving you any advice as to this, I protest
that on no account would I induce you to flinch, or to seek out
any by-way which might turn you out of the strait path
which God points out to you in his word. Although I have
heard that God has endowed you with admirable constancy,
for which I bless and magnify his name, I would yet rather
strive to increase you still more in such courage than in any
degree lessen it. For when we are brought to such an extremity
as to have no way of deliverance from the tyranny of the
enemies of the truth, save by subterfuges which draw back
and estrange us from the right path, there is no doubt but that
God calls us to seal with our blood the confession of faith
which we owe to him. For which reason if it were a question
as to declining either on one side or the other, it were
better to die. And in order that you may not be shaken by
threatenings or by anything whatsoever, look to the Son of God,
who did not spare his own life for the sake of our salvation,
in order that we might not reckon our life too precious when
needed to further his glory. Look to that heavenly crown
which is prepared for those who have fought courageously.
And above all, beware of drawing back, rather than which, we
ought to use our utmost endeavours to press forward to the
mark which God sets before us. But if the means be offered
you of withdrawing with your brethren, who desire with you
to worship God with one accord, I do not think that you ought
to refuse. In conclusion, you have to pray God, as I shall also
do, that he would bestow on you a spirit of counsel and prudence,
to decide what is right and fit for you to do; a spirit
of discretion, that you may not be deceived and take evil for
good; a spirit of steadfastness to be constant in wholly conforming
yourself to his will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear Brethren</span>,&mdash;We have to praise God that in the
captivity wherein you are, he vouchsafes you the strength
you ask, to worship him in purity, fearing more the being deprived
of his grace, than exposing yourself to the dangers
which may perhaps be about to occur to you, owing to the
malice of the adversaries; for the brother who is bearer of the
present letter,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> has declared to us that you have requested him
to return to you whenever he could; and that you desire to be
by all means exhorted to what is right, and confirmed in the
faith of the Gospel; and, indeed, now-a-days, there is greater
need of this than ever. It remains that this holy zeal of
yours be firm, so that you may continue to advance in the path
of salvation. As for the man, you know him; and on our part,
seeing he has here approved himself a God-fearing man, has
had his conversation among us holy and without reproach, and
has also always followed good and wholesome teaching, we
doubt not that he will comport himself faithfully among you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
and labour for your edification. As to the advice which he
has asked of us in your name, this is the order which it appears
to us you have to maintain, both as to prayer to God in beginning,
and as to being taught by him and others that God
shall give you, and to whom he has bestowed grace to minister
to you. Thereupon, see that you take courage to separate yourselves
from idolatries, from all superstitions, which are contrary
to the service of God, and to the acknowledgment and
confession which all Christians owe to him, for to that are we
called. When, in course of time, God has so prospered you,
that you are, as it were, an ecclesiastical body maintaining the
order already mentioned, and that there are some resolved to
withdraw themselves from prevailing pollutions, then you may
have the use of the sacraments. But we are nowise of opinion
that you should begin by them, or even that you should be
in a hurry to partake of the holy Supper, until you have
some order established among you. And indeed it is much
better for you to abstain from it, so that thus you may be led
to seek the means which will render you capable of receiving
it. That is, as we have already said, that you may be accustomed
to meet together in God's name, being as it were one
body; and that you may be separated from the idolatries which
it is not lawful to mix up with things holy. Nay, it would
not be lawful for a man to administer the sacraments to you,
unless he recognized you as a flock of Jesus Christ, and found
among you the form of a church. Meanwhile, take courage
and devote yourselves wholly to God, who has purchased us
so dearly by his own Son, and yield him the homage of body
and soul, showing that you account his glory more precious
than all besides; and that you set a higher value upon the
eternal salvation which is prepared for you in heaven, than
you do on this transitory life.</p>

<p>Wherefore, very dear brethren, making an end for the present,
we shall pray this merciful God to complete what he has
begun in you, to increase you in all spiritual blessings, and to
have you in his holy protection.</p>

<h2>CCCXXX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To Farel.</span></h2>

<h3>Acknowledgment of Farel's care for the Church of Geneva.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>14th October 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>I cannot find words, my dear Farel, in which to thank you
for the extraordinary interest you take in us, and for your equal
regard for this Church. I purposely abstained from, or at all
events was more sparing in writing you, as I was afraid to
take horseback immediately as you have done. Indeed I did
not care for troubling you until the very last, as you said that
it would not be acceptable to you if I should spare you. I certainly
know well enough, and indeed have experienced how you
like, yea, desire to undertake labour in behalf of the Church of
God, and how prompt you are in rendering us assistance. Of
the present state of things here I suppose you have been
informed by Viret, or rather by my letter to him, which I
wrote with the intention that you should get a reading of it.
Our enemies are making general exertions to have some hasty
decree passed at the meeting of the greater Council, about the
middle of November. I was thinking that it would be well to
have Viret here about that time. Yourself, indeed, I am
desirous to see here sooner, viz., on occasion of the final sentence
of Servetus. This will take place, I hope, before the end of
next week.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> As, however, the son of Claude Bernard has invited
Viret to his marriage on Sabbath next, I have no doubt
whatever but that Viret will accompany you if you come by
Lausanne. Yet I am unwilling, when there is no pressing
necessity for it, that you should move a foot unless it suit your
convenience.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> I have no doubt but that Viret will write you
his mind on the matter, if he can secure in time a trustworthy
messenger, for I asked him to do so. Earnest salutations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
all, especially our friend the Marquis,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Normandie, and my
restored friend. Adieu, most upright and very dear brother.
Salute earnestly your fellow-ministers, and your whole family.
May the Lord Christ ever guide, preserve, and bless you all.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Deliverance by the Swiss Churches regarding Servetus&mdash;vain efforts of Calvin to obtain
a mitigation of his punishment.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th October 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>Behold what will give you some gratification. Instead of
an epistle, here is a summary which will not occupy long time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
The messenger has returned from the Swiss Churches. They
are unanimous in pronouncing that Servetus has now renewed
those impious errors with which Satan formerly disturbed the
Church, and that he is a monster not to be borne. Those of
Bâle were judicious. The Zurichers were the most vehement
of all; for they not only animadverted in severe terms on the
atrocity of his impieties, but also exhorted our Senate to severity.
They of Schaffhausen will agree. Also to an appropriate
letter from the Bernese is added one from the Senate,
in which they stimulate ours not a little. Caesar, the comedian,
after feigning illness for three days, at length went up to the
assembly in order to free that wretch from punishment. Nor
was he ashamed to ask that inquiry might be made at the
[Council of the] Two Hundred. However, he was without
doubt condemned. He will be led forth to punishment to-morrow.
We endeavoured to alter the mode of his death, but
in vain. Why we did not succeed I defer for narration until
I see you. Adieu, most upright brother, and distinguished
minister of Christ. May God ever guide and preserve you.
Much health to all friends. Ours salute you again.</p>

<h3>He encourages her to come out of the spiritual bondage in which she is held.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<i>The 20th of November 1553.</i>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Madame and good Sister</span>,&mdash;If God had given you a husband
who had been loyal to you, and had lived in concord
with you, there would be need to comfort you at present, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
to exhort you to patience. But since he who ought to have
considered you as dear to him as the half of himself, has been,
while he lived, a very severe scourge, you have occasion rather
to acknowledge that in removing him our gracious God has
acted in mercy towards you. Furthermore, the annoyances
which you have undergone ought to teach you to humble yourself
under the hand of Him who has thought fit thus to try you,
in order to make you feel the value of his help, and how his faithfulness
never fails his people. But all the ill-treatment under
which you have pined away, has been nothing at all compared
to that wretched captivity by which you were kept back from
the worship of God, and kept away from the Son of God, so as to
be unable to keep faith in the holy and sacred marriage which
he has contracted with you; and now you must all the more
consider, to what end he has set you so much at liberty. Call
to mind, I beseech you, the continual sighs you have been heaving
for so long a time. Although you had many kinds of grief, I
doubt not that your chief regret was that of not being permitted
to devote yourself entirely to the service of God. Consider
well, whether you have not vowed daily before God, that you
wished for nothing but the means of getting rid of the servitude
in which you were held. Now that your wish is granted,
rely upon it that God holds you to your promise. It is for you
to anticipate him, even as your conscience prompts you, without
incitements from without. And yet further, call to remembrance
that Saint Paul, in saying that married persons are as it were
divided, but that widows have nothing to do but to apply themselves
entirely to God, takes away from you the excuse which
hitherto you could have alleged. It is certain that nothing
whatever ought to hinder us from the discharge of what is due
to our heavenly Father, and to that kind Redeemer whom he
has sent to us; but the better the opportunity of each, so much
the more guilty does he become if he does not the more readily
discharge his duty. I am well aware that you have regard to
your children, and I do not say but that this is right, provided
that the sovereign Father of both you and them be not left out.
But consider that the greatest benefit which you can confer
upon them, is to shew them the way to follow God. However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
that may be, it will no longer be permitted you to allege that
you are under compulsion, and forced to offend, seeing that God
has opened a door to you which might have been shut. What
remains for you then but to take courage, yea even so as to
strive to the very utmost to surmount all the difficulties which
keep you back: for I know very well that you cannot without
great opposition dedicate yourself fully to our Lord Jesus.
But to come to the point, make a right use of the knowledge
which he has for a long time past vouchsafed you; and do not
allow the zeal which he has at one time imprinted by the Holy
Spirit upon your heart to die away; and do not knowingly
quench the holy desire which has burned within you in bygone
times. Behold how God allows those to slip away who grow
careless little by little, and how easily he permits them to be
so utterly depraved that they go to perdition; and it is just
that the Lord should thus avenge himself upon those who
have preferred the vanities of the world to the treasure of his
Gospel. Now, while many allow themselves to be seduced by
such examples, let this serve as a warning to you, to keep all
the more closely fenced about in fear and solicitude. Finally,
let the adversity which you have passed through, during a part
of your life, make you ponder all the more seriously that true
happiness and perfect glory which is prepared for us in heaven,
that we may not beguile ourselves with worldly repose, which
can only be fleeting and highly seasoned with never-ceasing
care and troubles, and, worse than all, which makes us unmindful
of that soul-rest which alone is blessed. But that
I may not seem to distrust your good-will, I shall conclude for
the present, after having affectionately commended me to your
kind favour and prayers, and having besought our merciful
God that if, in times past, he has poured forth upon you the
graces and virtues of his Holy Spirit, he would not only
continue them, but would increase you therein, and never allow
you to decline from the straight path, but advance you therein
still more and more, while in the meantime he holds you under
his protection. I do not know whereabouts your brother is,
or if I should give him pleasure by writing to him, which withholds
me from doing so. Nevertheless, I desire that God would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
hold him with a strong hand, so that he may not be estranged
from him.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> From what I hear, he is a little gone out of the
way in some things, and has much need to be brought back into
the straight path; but as I do not know how to effect this, I
reserve it for a better opportunity. Once more I commit you
to the love of our merciful God.&mdash;Your humble brother and
servant,</p>

<h3>Recommendation of several English refugees in Switzerland.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>20th November 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>Those Englishmen, on leaving this place to resort to you,
requested me to give them an introduction, in order that by
your assistance they might secure suitable lodgings. Indeed
they were anxious to live with yourself or M. Beza, but they
will not urge this, especially as they were informed that they
could scarcely expect it. You will, however, receive them as a
good and kind host should; for I understand that they are
pious and honourable men, and am confident that they will be
easily accommodated. The elder, the father of the young man,
is a person of good birth, and was wealthy in his own country.
The son merits higher praise for piety and holy zeal; for, under
the reign of King Edward, seeing that the Church suffered
from want of pastors, he undertook voluntarily the labours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
that office. Add to this, that they, with a generous liberality
assisted with their entire property our French brethren, who,
on account of the Gospel, had crossed over to England. We
must on no account, therefore, deny to these exiles at least a
similar friendship. You will also inform our friend Beza of
the intended visit of a friend, who will, I expect, be with him
to-morrow or soon afterwards. He is brother to Luzarch,
whom he had formerly at his house&mdash;older than he, however,
although not the eldest of the family. Our bold leaders have
dined together several times since you left.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> I have not as yet
witnessed any proof of that intrepidity of which they were
boasting. Adieu, very worthy brother. Salute M. Beza and

home. May the Lord guide and watch over you.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<h3>Appeal to the Magistrates of Zurich in reference to ecclesiastical discipline&mdash;thanks
for the aid afforded by the ministers of that Church in the affair of Servetus.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th November 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>Here is another new labour for you. Those desirous of
living a life of licentiousness, have not ceased for the past seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
years to oppose the discipline of the Church, which is in a
tolerable state of efficiency here. We would not, however, have
been so much annoyed by loose-living men among the common
people, if there had not been leaders who wished to convert
this license into a means of power. It has now come to
this, that whatever church order has hitherto flourished will be
rooted up if you cannot afford us a remedy. And it is on this
account that our very excellent brother, M. de Budé, has not
scrupled to undertake a journey to you, at this trying season of
the year, in order to acquaint you with the whole business.
However, the main point is in brief this: that your most illustrious
Senate give as their reply, that the form which we have
hitherto employed is agreeable to the word of God; in the
next place, that it discountenance innovation. You will learn
the rest from the circular letter which I have written; on this
condition, however, that should you not deem it expedient to
circulate it more widely, you communicate it expressly to M.
Gualter. I leave it entirely to your judgment. Should I
obtain through you those two chief points, viz., unambiguous
confirmation of our regulations by the suffrages of your Senate,
and a discountenancing in our men of their desire for innovation,
it will bring peace to this Church for a long time to come.
I hope you have received the letter which I sent you lately, in
which I thanked you all in my own name and that of my
brethren, for the faithful and pious response which you gave in
the case of Servetus. The very brilliant commendation with
which you honoured us, had its own weight with good men.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
It has not as yet, as you may perceive, put a check upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
lawless and the abandoned. However, things will be better in
a short time, I trust, if you will come to our assistance. A
citizen of yours has conveyed to you the book of Servetus and
that farrago which you asked for. Of the sad desolation of
England you know too much; I shall stop therefore. Adieu,
most distinguished sir, and venerable brother. Salute earnestly
M. Gualter, your wife, your relatives, and the faithful. May
the Lord shield you all by his protection, and guide you by
his Spirit.</p>

<h3>Account of the struggles at Geneva for the maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline&mdash;appeal
to the Pastors of Zurich for their influence with the magistrates of that
town.</h3>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <i>26th November 1553</i>.
</p>

<p>I feel indeed ashamed, very excellent and sincerely respected
brethren, at bringing before you again a new topic of consideration,
inasmuch as our Council troubled you lately with the case
of Servetus. There is, however, good grounds for excuse in
the present instance: for, as the wickedness of certain parties
is vaunting itself with a headstrong insolence not to be resisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the pious and upright are forced to apply to you for aid; and
while I am assuredly anxious above all things to avoid giving
you trouble, I have, nevertheless, from the necessity of the case,
thought it my duty not to spare you. From the time of my
return to this Church, discipline has at least made tolerable
advancement, if it has not been perfect, or such as could have
been wished. The Consistory was instituted, and charged with
the regulation of morals. It possessed no civil jurisdiction,
but simply the administration of rebuke from the word of God;
its ultimate punishment was excommunication. Among the
other disputes which Satan has been continually stirring up
during the past three years, the present one has been a source
of extreme vexation to us; for a certain wretch, of abandoned
effrontery, having attempted, contrary to the decision of the
Church, to force his way to the Holy Table, when he saw that
we were prepared to offer a determined resistance to his madness,
filled the city with a great tumult. Nor, indeed, had he
much difficulty in doing so, seeing that he could make choice
of the irreligious faction to act the drama. And because he
was not only patronized by those men, who were not ashamed
to make a noise in defence of Servetus, but also aided and
abetted by them, he, by their assistance, succeeded, after an
intense struggle, and by very outrageous behaviour, in prevailing
upon the Greater Council rashly to break through the established
and hitherto observed order of the Church. We again
opposed them. Those who had fallen into the error have resolved
upon consulting the Swiss Churches. And although
they have not yet written you, yet because it is certain that the
reply of your most illustrious Council will be in accordance with
your mind, I have thought that you should be apprised and
solicited regarding it in time. Accordingly, a very excellent
and eminently judicious man, and my dearly beloved brother,
has gladly undertaken a journey to you, in the name of the
Church, at the cost of great toil and trouble at this severe
season of the year. Let me earnestly beseech you, therefore, in
the first place, to reflect, that it should not be treated by you
as some ordinary matter; but, that the case proposed for decision
concerns the entire welfare of this Church. And because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
I consider that it would be perfidious cowardice in me, so long
as I occupy my present position, not to contend keenly, even to
the utmost, in behalf of a holy and lawful discipline, I have
resolved that I should a hundred times rather leave this life&mdash;not
to say this place&mdash;than suffer to be overthrown, that
which I am confident is taken from the word of God. All are
not agreed at the present time regarding excommunication.
Nor am I ignorant that there are pious and learned men who
do not consider excommunication to be necessary under Christian
princes. And yet I am confident that there is no person
of sound mind, and unbiassed disposition, who would discountenance
the employment of it. To me it is clearly the doctrine
of Christ. If on any occasion people cannot be got to come
under this yoke of Christ, after pastors have exerted themselves
to the utmost respecting it, it is their business then, not ours;
but it would be exceedingly base for us to stand by and look
on, while an edifice which Christ committed to our defence, was
being overthrown, and utterly razed to the ground. Nor have
I any fear that you will censure my zeal for its pertinacity,
when once you have got a thorough understanding of the plan
which we have followed up to the present time, and of which
godless men are endeavouring forcibly to deprive us. And
now, if it shall appear to you to contain nothing but what
is consonant with the pure doctrine of Christ, I solemnly beseech
you to use your influence, so that your most illustrious
Council may bear a similar testimony. For this is of especial
importance, in order that our men may understand that they
cannot compass that innovation which they desire, without
abandoning the example of Christ, or, if this seem too strong,
without swerving from it. As for whatever is not sufficiently
set forth in this letter, M. de Budé will explain it in your
presence. The Lord will be a witness to myself and my colleagues,
that for four years wicked men have done all in their
power, to accomplish the gradual overthrow of this Church in
its present tolerable condition. I saw through their secret
machinations from the first; but I did not know what to make
of it, unless that the Lord was preparing whips before our eyes,
in order that by inspiring us with fear, he might win us back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
to himself. For the past two years, we have been precisely as
if living among the professed enemies of Christ. The last act
is now played; for after many victories, the enemy meditates a
splendid triumph over Christ, his doctrine, his ministers, and
in a word, over all his members. I shall not speak of how
inhumanly, insolently, and barbarously, they have tortured
those exiles of Christ who had embraced his faith. And,
indeed the very perpetrators of those wrongs will not be able
to deny, with what mildness, modesty, and patience, those who
found a ready asylum here, have borne all their indignities.
Their profligacy has now reached such a pitch, that having
shaken off all shame, they obstinately desire to convert the
House of the Lord into a brothel. And, in order that you
may know how foully dishonourable they are, they lately,
when our brother Farel was here,&mdash;to whom they are, as you
know, under so great obligations,&mdash;and who gave them a free
and independent advice, were so inflamed with rage, that they
made bold to threaten him with a criminal prosecution.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>I am indeed well enough aware, that it is nothing new for
factious men, in a free city, to stir up mobs. Yet our Council
have been deplorably left to themselves, for they demanded of
the people of Neuchatel that they should deliver up to them
the father of their liberty, yea, the father of this Church, as
accused of a capital offence. I feel constrained to proclaim the
infamy of this city, although I could desire to wipe it off with
my blood. Farel came: before he entered the city, the officer
of the Council delivered an official intimation at my house, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
he was not to enter the pulpit. I shall not dwell upon the
rest; for it is sufficient to let you have a taste of this ingratitude,
which will stir the just indignation of all good and honest
men. And as I have many reasons for not making an open
lament over our evils, so, of this be convinced, and that briefly,
that unless Satan receive a check through you, he will fling the
reins loose altogether. It becomes you, therefore, to make as
great exertions, as if the welfare of this Church was entirely in
your hands. Nor let it be ascribed to peevishness in us, if we
would rather yield up our position than sacrifice our opinions.
For all good men know, that we have been hitherto over-accommodating,
in order to obviate troubles, even when there
could be no doubt at all, that our patience was tried by the
wicked. But we must not yield them this victory; nay, we
must not knowingly and wilfully surrender the entire liberty of
the Church; not only because the authority of our ministry
would fall to the ground, but because the name of Christ would
be subjected to any the foulest disgrace: an unbridled license
for all vices would increase with more and more effrontery: the
condition of the pious would not only become exposed to all
manner of wrongs, but utterly cast down by suffering,&mdash;they
would lie in sad prostration. This makes me all the more confident,
that you will do your endeavour to assist, by your support,
the faithful of this place, so that they may worship God
with a little more peace. Adieu, my very excellent and truly
revered brethren. May the Lord be present with you, and
guide you by his Spirit; may he supply you with an abundance
of wisdom, sufficient, not only for maintaining your own
Church, but also for upholding that of others. Fare ye well,
my very excellent and truly revered brethren. May the Lord
be ever present with you, to guide and watch over you.</p>

Church, with all possible zeal, to your faithfulness and wisdom.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>The messenger arrived six days after I had received your
letter. The people of Schaffhausen give a pious and judicious
reply; those of Bâle give a very meagre response; they offer
us almost no advice, sending us simply a copy of their edicts,
without, however, pronouncing any judgment. Our brother,
Sulzer, earnestly apologizes for not having been able to accomplish
more. And I can perceive, in various ways, indeed, most
upright and respected brother, how strenuously you have
exerted yourself in our behalf; nor do I doubt but that our
friend Gualter performed his part also. Whatever may have
happened, I feel that I owe more to your singular faithfulness
and remarkable zeal, than I am able to express. But the Lord,
in whose cause you have made such endeavours, will give you
his reward. Assuredly my affection for you will not be found
wanting. Nothing has as yet been done in the Senate, the
letters being still in the hand of the translator. Seeing that
we have to do with very base calumniators, they will get up
various quarrels with us. I expect, however, either victory, or
a satisfactory winding up of the matter. As soon as anything
has been effected, I shall see to it that you be informed of it.
For it will be a matter of common gratulation to us, if the
event turn out according to our wishes. The pamphlet against
Servetus, in which I have set forth that argument which you
wished me to employ, was published at the late Frankfort Fair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
With respect to those matters which the men at Bâle are
making a clamour about, and of which I complained to you, I
resolved to spare their reputation, and have done so, lest the
disgrace of a few men should bring dishonour on the whole
Church;<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> and certainly they deserve to be overwhelmed in
eternal oblivion. The progress of events convinced me of what
had not previously occurred to me, viz., that your letter concerning
Servetus, should be inserted in the book; and trusting to
your kindness, I took the liberty of inserting it. Should you
not approve of my plan, however, I shall endeavour to remedy
it. Adieu, very distinguished sir, illustrious minister of Christ,
and revered brother. May the Lord continue to guide you by
the spirit of wisdom and fortitude, and to protect your Church.</p>

<p>Salute earnestly in my name your colleagues, and your
family. My colleagues, MM. Celso Martinengo and Budé, and
the other brethren, respectfully salute you.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

</p>

<p>Good men have indeed sent money to be laid out on the
banished brethren and the exiles. They have ordered one part
to be distributed among us, and they have designed the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
two parts for the poor of Lausanne and your own city. Our
friend Beza caused twenty-five gold pieces to be handed over
to them. However, as but few exiles have hitherto gone among
you, so far as I know, especially of that sort which is so numerous
here, might you not, if you are not in immediate need,
expend at your own discretion what would relieve the necessity
of others? I do not ask you, certainly, to make a remission to
us, but I wished to advise you on the matter, that if it should
seem proper to you, you might transmit a certain sum to those
who are in urgent need of money. Nevertheless, I do not dictate
any course to you, but fearing, as I did, that you might be
troubled with some doubts about how to act, I thought it
better to anticipate them. The messenger has at length returned
from the Helvetian Churches. Our Council will meet
with a disappointment to-morrow in their replies. I expect
a great deal of quarrelling, the issue of which, however, will
perhaps turn out more fortunately than the wicked, who are
now beginning to get crestfallen, had previously calculated
upon. But there is in the other respect no cordiality. When
we shall have completed the contests which are in store for us,
I shall write you the whole more fully. Adieu, most upright
brother, assist us with your prayers.</p>

<p>The men of Zurich prudently dissuade from making any
change. Those of Bâle, without interposing any judgment,
send a written copy of their own edicts. The people of Schaffhausen
are the most judicious of all. Our neighbours push it
coldly aside; a thing which I expected from the first. Salute
your brethren and friends earnestly in my name. May the

<h2>CCCXXXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">To an Italian Lady.</span><a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></h2>

<h3>He exhorts her to withdraw, by a voluntary exile, from the persecution and idolatry
reigning in Italy.</h3>


<p class="sig">[1553.]</p>

<p>Though I knew, noble lady, that you would have need of
an interpreter to understand my letters, yet some friends have
encouraged me to write to you, or rather they have warmly
pressed on me the accomplishment of that duty. But for that
purpose I have made choice of the Latin language, because I
was confident that you would find about you many persons to
translate it into Italian, whereas the knowledge of French is
unknown, or very rare among you. And first of all, that my
letter may not fail in its effect, I must entreat you not to refuse
it a favourable reception. This request I am sure I shall obtain
of you, if you reflect on the object I have in view. Moreover
the persons, by whose recommendation I write, pledge
themselves that of your own accord and willingly you will do
what I ask of you. Nor indeed would it be consistent with
your piety to slight a person whom you acknowledge to be
one of the servants of Christ, especially when he speaks from
zeal for your salvation. And indeed I have just reason to
begin with congratulating you, for I hear that you have embraced
the faith of the gospel in such a manner that nothing is
dearer to you than the pure worship of God; a singular zeal
for which ought to predominate in the minds of all those who
have truly tasted the sweetness of that grace which is offered
to us in Christ. For to that end the Son of God has manifested
himself, and daily lays before us his treasures, that, renouncing
the allurements of the world, we should meditate on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
life which is in heaven. To that end also, God regenerates us
by the incorruptible seed of his doctrine, that our whole life
may bring forth the fruits of justice corresponding to his holy
adoption. Many indeed in these days impiously make a mock
of Christ, seeking in his doctrine a cloak for their licentiousness.
But we see in what terrible ways God punishes these acts of
sacrilege. It is to me, however, a subject of rejoicing, that you
on the contrary have concentrated all your thoughts on this
point: namely, by holiness of life to add lustre to the gospel.
And hence it appears that the gospel has struck deep and
lively roots in your heart. But because, in the present day,
the world abounds in numberless seductions, it behoves you
not only to be animated with a right frame of mind to hold on
your Christian course, but also to be armed with invincible
courage to carry on your warfare under Christ your heavenly
leader. For at the present day impiety has gained such
ground, and especially among you the tyranny of Antichrist
rages to such an extent, that you cannot, without much peril
and many struggles, offer to God an unpolluted worship. Of
which thing you are yourself the best witness; and in this the
strength of your piety shines out most conspicuously, not only
that you do not, like too many, indulge in the prevailing vices,
but because, in your wisdom, you see to how wretched a slavery
you are condemned in your own country, you had rather submit
to a voluntary exile than remain entangled among the defilements
which contaminate you. Now since God has roused
you up to this point, I conceive that it is also incumbent on
me to add a new impulse to your zeal, and further this holy
resolution of yours. If, where you now are, it were in your
power not to defraud God of that obedience which is due to
him, I should persuade you to remain rather than abandon
your country, to seek a far-distant and foreign land, by a
tedious journey, at great expense, and with immense inconvenience.
But when the threats and terrors of the enemies of
Christ do not permit you to make such a profession of your
faith as becomes you, the infirmity of the flesh is also an impediment
to you; so that I have no hesitation in advising and
urging you to make your escape as speedily as possible from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
these deadly entanglements. And even if I had been silent,
it is impossible that the goads of your own conscience should
not incessantly stimulate you to look out for a remedy.
Meanwhile you must be on your guard not to cut yourself off
from an opportunity of departure, by spinning out the time
uselessly in deliberations. No doubt, in so arduous a matter,
nothing is to be attempted rashly; but if the will of God do
not appear obscure to you, you cannot, without serious wrong,
long agitate, with an irresolute purpose, first one point and
then another. Resolve then seriously that what God has enjoined
is to be immediately executed, and, at the same time,
without procrastinating, make ready for your journey. Nor
let the vain and flattering fallacies with which most persons
impose on themselves delay you, but let this reflection be ever
present to your mind, that the confession of our faith is too
precious a thing in God's sight, to permit us to consider it as
a slight offence to wallow in impure superstitions. Add to
this, that at present, like a famished sheep, you are wandering
out of Christ's fold and pastures in a barren desert. Nor does
it escape me how difficult and painful a thing it is for you to
emigrate from your country, to live on a foreign soil far away
from your kinsfolk, at your advanced age not only to change
your habitation, but forego all those little comforts, of which it
were hard and cruel, even in the prime of life, to be deprived.
To all this I have but one consideration to oppose, but which,
I trust, you will deem amply sufficient. It is this: if we have
had a due foretaste of the life which is in heaven, there is
nothing upon earth of such importance as to abate our ardour
in the pursuit of the heavenly blessing. Moreover, the Son
of God, not only because we owe him such a debt of gratitude,
but also because he is possessed of supreme power, deserves
that we should prefer his honour to all the honours, delights,
riches, and comforts of the world. And were it permitted us
to inhabit a place where God is worshipped, and his name invoked
in purity, it were far better to live in exile there, than
to live at ease in our own country, from which Christ, the
sovereign of heaven and earth, is banished. Even if no necessity
compelled you to quit the nest, yet you were no daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of God, if this earthly life did not seem to you a pilgrimage.
But now when the sacrilegious tyranny of Antichrist expels
you from it, and God calls you with a loud voice to go forth;
let not the condition of your peregrination seem painful to you,
till the time when at last he shall bring us all together into
his eternal inheritance. Noble and illustrious lady, for whom
I shall always cherish an esteem, farewell. May the Lord
direct you by the Spirit of his wisdom, increase your fortitude
and constancy, and shelter you by his protection.</p>

<h3>Christian exhortations&mdash;sending of a minister.</h3>

<p class="sig">[1553.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Seigneur and brother</span>,&mdash;We praise God for having
inclined your heart to try if it will be possible to erect, by your
means, a small church on the place where you reside. And
indeed according as the agents of the Devil strive by every
act of violence to abolish the true religion, extinguish the
doctrine of salvation, and exterminate the name of Jesus Christ,
it is very just that we should labour on our side to further the
progress of the gospel, that, by these means, God may be served
in purity, and the poor wandering sheep may be put under the
protection of the sovereign Pastor to whom every one should
be subject. And you know that it is a sacrifice well pleasing
to God, to advance the spread of the Gospel by which we are
enlightened in the way of salvation, to dedicate our life to the
honour of him who has ransomed us at so costly a price in
order to bear rule in the midst of us. Therefore we pray you
to take courage, as we supplicate at the same time the Father of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
all virtue to confirm you in your holy purpose. Meanwhile,
because we have heard that you desire to be assisted by us,
and to have a man proper for the work of edification, we have
not wished to be a wanting to our duty. We present to you
then our brother, the bearer of this letter, who has shewn us by
deeds by what zeal he was animated. He has had such a
conversation among us that we doubt not but that his life
will be an excellent example. His doctrine is pure, and as far
as we can judge, those who will content themselves with being
taught by him in simplicity, and will shew themselves docile,
will be able to profit by his preaching. We do not beg you
to give him a kind welcome, being convinced of your favourable
dispositions. Only deign to let him feel by experience
that his labour among you is not in vain.</p>

<p>Whereupon, dearest Seigneur and brother, having affectionately
commended us to your prayers, we will supplicate
the heavenly Father to continue to have you in his holy keeping,
to increase in you his spiritual gifts, to govern you in
such a manner by his Spirit, that his name may be more and
more glorified in you.</p>

Blanchet, cut off by the plague in 1543, had, of his own accord, offered himself for
the service of the hospital set apart for those afflicted with the plague. He fell
under it, a victim of his devotedness, in September 1545. His wife and two
of his children were carried off a few days afterwards by the scourge, which almost
wholly depopulated several quarters of the city.</p></div>

<cite>Lepida Farelli Vocatio</cite>. In that letter Calvin vigorously urges his friend to repair
to Geneva, by calling to mind the religious violence with which he was himself
detained there, by the voice of Farel, at the time of his first entrance into that city
in 1536. "Do you expect that I should thunder as you were wont to do, when you
wished forcibly to draw me hither?" The urgencies of Calvin were fruitless,
and the Church of Neuchatel retained, for twenty years longer, the services and
the indefatigable activity of Farel.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The plague had dispersed the regents and students of the College of Geneva,
and Calvin was labouring at the re-organization of that establishment. He had
already proposed to the Council, in March 1545, to call to Geneva the celebrated
Maturin Cordier, <em>as president of the regents</em>; but this proposal ended in nothing, and
Maturin Cordier remained at Lausanne.</p></div>

they were both alike disposed to seek the alliance of the Kings of France and England,

is pointed at in this letter, is no other than Michael Servetus&mdash;seven years before
the trial which was to attach so fatal a celebrity to his name. Settled as a
physician at Vienne, in Dauphiny, he kept up a correspondence with Calvin, under
the cover of John Frellon, and he had just sent the Reformer an extract of
the work which was in preparation under the title of <cite>Christianismi restitutio</cite>, expressing
at the same time the desire of coming to Geneva. Then it was, that
Calvin wrote to Farel the letter which has been so often cited, where this passage
occurs, "Servet has lately written to me, and has added to his letter a large
volume of his own delirious fancies.... <em>If it may be agreeable to me, he undertakes
that he would come hither. But I will not interpose my assurance of his
safety, for if he shall come, provided that my authority is of any avail, I shall not
suffer him to depart alive.</em>"*&mdash;Letter of the 13th February 1546. We know how that
terrible threat was realized seven years afterwards.

within the bounds of the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris. Meaux, Seulis,
Orleans, reckoned numerous martyrs. One named Jean Chapot of Dauphiné, colporteur
of Geneva, arrested at Paris, was condemned to death, after having undergone
the most cruel tortures. He had his tongue cut out before he was cast
into the flames. "The dispersion," says Beza, "was widespread, but it led to
the great advancement of many churches which were built up of the stones of that
ruin."&mdash;<cite>Hist. Eccl.</cite> tom. i. p. 82. <cite>Histoire des Martyrs</cite>, pp. 170, 177.</p></div>

a long illness, his wife, Elizabeth Turtaz, of Orbe, with whom he had lived for many

very touching manner, in a letter written many years afterwards to Calvin:&mdash;"I was
so completely dispirited and prostrated by that arrow of affliction, that the whole
world appeared to me nothing but a burden. There was nothing pleasant, nothing
that could mitigate my grief of mind."&mdash;<cite>Calv. Epist. et Resp.</cite>, p. 53. The friends of
Viret, and especially Farel and Calvin, lavished upon him, during that trial, marks
of the tenderest and most brotherly affection. The familiar correspondence of Calvin

himself to England. His leanings toward heterodoxy were veiled from the

his abilities, without having an entire confidence in the solidity of his doctrines. The
ever-recurring changes of his unsettled life led him, at a later period, to class himself
with the sect of the anti-Trinitarians. His discourses, so much admired by Cardinal

enforced, and checked improprieties without respect of persons. The Captain-General,
Amy Perrin, the Syndic Corna, and several other persons, having, contrary to the
prohibitions, danced in a private house, "It is ordained," as is contained in the Registers
of 12th April 1546, "that they all be imprisoned;" and with regard to the wife
of Amy Perrin, who spoke insolently to the Consistory, that she also be imprisoned,
and be required to find security. Perrin, to avoid undergoing the punishment pronounced
against him, had recourse to the pretext of a journey to Lyons; but he was
incarcerated on his return. The Syndic Corna acknowledged his fault, and, after a
deposition of some days, he was reinstated in his office. The minister, Henry de la

<p>
Amy Perrin, one of the earliest hearers of Farel and Froment at Geneva, contributed
powerfully to the disenthralment and reformation of his native country. At one
with the Reformers in the abolition of the ancient worship and in the proclamation
of the new, which he regarded as the security for the independence of Geneva, he broke
with them the moment they undertook to correct manners, after having reformed beliefs.
He then became the head of that party of undisciplined children of Geneva,
"who wished to live according to their own inclination, without suffering themselves
to be restrained by the words of the preachers," and whose triumph led to the banishment
of the ministers, (1538.) Commissioned, two years afterwards, to negotiate their
recall, he appeared to be reconciled to Calvin, and to submit to the institutions of the
Calvinistic discipline; but the submission could not be lasting, and we again find him,
in 1545, along with Pierre Vandel and the two Bertheliers, at the head of the party
that must needs continue to strive with the ministers, until their total defeat, (May
1555.) Of an irascible temperament, of easy and frivolous manners, Amy took pleasure
in fêtes, and in appearing in public magnificently dressed. Being accused (see the
preceding letter) of having taken part in unlawful dances, he refused to compear before
the Consistory, incurred, with his wife, the just rigours of the Seigneury, and became
the implacable enemy of Calvin, who, in a letter at once moderate and powerful,
essayed in vain to bring him back to the path of obedience and duty.</p></div>

Charles V. to universal rule, the King of France and the Protestant Princes of Germany
had resumed negotiations, that must seemingly issue in a lasting treaty.
This treaty of alliance was for long the object of the prayers and the hopes of
Calvin, who reckoned upon extracting from it advantageous results to the French
Protestants, and an implicit toleration for churches until then subjected to the
most violent persecutions. He pressed Farel and Viret, one or other, to repair to
Germany, to hasten the progress of negotiations and determine the conditions of the
alliance.</p></div>

addressed by Calvin to the widow of the celebrated William Budé, great-grandson of
the secretary to King Charles V., and one of the most learned personages of the period
of the revival of letters. William Budé having declared in his will that he wished to be
buried without ceremony, this circumstance led to the supposition that he had died
in the faith of the Reformed. His widow not being able to make free profession of her
faith at Paris, was about to settle at Geneva, on the solicitation of Calvin, (June 1549.)
She was accompanied by her daughter and three of her sons, Louis, Francis, and John
de Budé, who held a distinguished rank in the republic. The best known of the three
brothers is John de Budé, Sieur de Vérace, the particular friend of Calvin and of Théodore
de Bèze. He was received an inhabitant of Geneva the 27th June 1549, burgess
the 2d May 1555, member of both Councils in 1559, fulfilled several important missions
to the Protestant princes of Germany, and died in 1589, after having rendered
distinguished services to his new country, and thereby added fresh lustre to his family,
whose descendants still live at Geneva.&mdash;Galiffe, <cite>Notices Généalogiques des Familles

be welcome," &amp;c. The family of Budé were then preparing to leave France. Two
years afterwards, they settled at Geneva, as appears from their registration in the
list of the inhabitants, 27th June 1549, and the following passage of a letter from
Viret to Calvin, 12th June of the same year: "<em>I rejoice that the Budé have arrived,
along with their mother.</em>"&mdash;MSS. of the Library of Geneva.</p></div>

During the period that the Reformation was for a while overcome in Germany, and
that it had to sustain the rudest conflicts in order to its establishment at Geneva, the
most alarming reports were spread among the French Protestants, and carried discouragement
and dismay into their ranks. Calvin, addressing his brethren from the
midst of the struggle in which he was engaged against the party of the Libertins, reassured
and comforted them by his letters, and exhorted them to place their entire
confidence in God.</p></div>

died in 1573, leaving the reputation of one of the most learned men of his
time, and of a most versatile spirit in matters of religion. It has been justly said of
him, that he was a Roman Catholic in France, a Lutheran at Strasbourg, and a Calvinist

of their studies at Paris." It is to one of the members of that noble family, Claude

the doctrine of Zwingle, with the view of approximating to that of the French Reformer.
Still, however, the mystery of the spiritual presence of Christ, under external
and material symbols, was not expressed in it with sufficient clearness. Calvin
had fully criticised this book in a letter, or rather in an extended memoir, the original
of which is preserved at Zurich, under the title, <cite>Censura Libri Bullingeri de Sacramentis</cite>,
Geneva, 27th February 1547. This memoir, written with a brotherly freedom,
concludes with these words:&mdash;"You thus have what in your book I desire to see
corrected, that it may meet with absolute approval. I make no note of the parts that
merit commendation. I have discharged the office of a friend, by complying with

the Council to take order therein."&mdash;28th October. "Farel testifies anew that too
little regard is had for the character and merits of Calvin; that he has no equal in

John Sturm, a learned humanist and able politician, born at Sleida in 1507, passed
through a brilliant course of study at the University of Louvain. Famous from his
youth for learning and eloquence, he was nominated in 1529 Professor of Belles
Lettres in the College of France, founded by Francis I., and became in 1537 Rector
of the celebrated Academy of Strasbourg. Connected thenceforward with the German
and Swiss Reformers, he occupied an important place in the religious negotiations of
the age, maintained a correspondence with the principal European sovereigns, and
died in 1583.
</p>
<p>
Calvin and Sturm were known to each other, and associated together during the
sojourn of the French Reformer at Strasbourg. From this period date the relations
they maintained during many years, numerous precious memorials of which are to be
found in the correspondence of Calvin. See on the subject of Sturm the curious and

George of Wurtemberg, Count of Montbeliard, having fallen under the disgrace of

ranks of the Protestant princes, was stript of his Principality in 1548, and withdrew
to the Canton of Berne.&mdash;Ruchat, vol. v. p. 368. At the termination of that revolution,
the Churches of the Pays de Montbeliard were dispersed, and their ministers,
among whom was to be remarked Pierre Toussain, were banished, and sought an
asylum in the different Reformed Cantons of Switzerland, until the period of the
restoration, both political and religious, that replaced them some years afterwards in

the Swiss Churches, and for their happy issue! Several persons, says Ruchat, zealous
for religion, imagined that the clergy of Zurich and Geneva did not hold the same
doctrine on the Supper, on the ground of some slight difference in the expressions
they made use of; and this divergence caused them pain. Accordingly, as they held
Bullinger and Calvin in great esteem, and desired to be able to profit equally by
writings published by theologians of both churches, they deemed it necessary to institute
conferences with a view to union; and Calvin, ever full of zeal for the interests
of the Church, did not hesitate to subscribe to this petition.&mdash;<cite>Hospinien</cite>, tom. ii. p.

for the adoption of a common formula regarding the sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, he addressed to the ministers of the Church of Berne a statement of what the
Church of Geneva held on that important question, in the hope of leading that Church
into the proposed union. But the Bernese clergy, placed in a position of absolute
dependence on the seigneury, could not adopt any formula without its authority; and
the seigneurs, jealous of their influence, regarded with a distrustful eye any communication
with the ministers of Geneva. The approaches of Calvin, also, were not
well received, and the noble desire of the Reformer for the union of the Helvetian
churches, realized at a later period by Bullinger, met with no response.&mdash;<em>Ruchat</em>, tom.

of great domestic affliction. Early in April 1549, Calvin lost the worthy partner of
his life, Idelette de Bure, whose frail and delicate health gave way under the pressure
of a protracted illness, and whose last hours are known to us by the touching picture
given of them by the Reformer. The consolations of friendship, and the consideration
of the important duties he had to discharge, supported Calvin in this affliction,
and the self-control which he manifested during the first days of his bereavement,
excited the admiration of his friends. Viret wrote him on this occasion as follows:
"Wonderfully and incredibly have I been refreshed, not by empty rumours alone, but
especially by numerous messengers who have informed me how you, with a heart so
broken and lacerated, have attended to all your duties even better than hitherto ... and
that, above all, at a time when grief so fresh, and on that account all the
more severe, might have prostrated your mind. Go on then as you have begun ...
and I pray God most earnestly that you may be enabled to do so, and that you may
receive daily greater comfort and be strengthened more and more."&mdash;Letter of 10th

extreme eagerness. His envoys, Boisrigault, Liancourt, Lavan, and Menage overran
the Cantons, scattering everywhere proofs of his liberality, to obtain a renewal
of the ancient treaties. Everywhere, says the Swiss historian, their proposals were
welcomed, except at Berne and at Zurich. In the latter town, Bullinger rose with
great energy against this negotiating with a man who was converting a loyal and
Christian people into a nation of hired murderers. He called to their recollection
the persecutions of which France had been the theatre, and adjured his fellow-citizens
to avoid all terms with a persecuting monarch, who was covered with the
blood of their brethren. Better aware than Bullinger of the dangers which the
supremacy of the Emperor was spreading over the various states of Europe, and
over the Reformed Churches of Germany and Switzerland, and hoping, perhaps,
to obtain by a treaty some relief to the faithful of France, Calvin was in favour of
the French alliance, and in this remarkable letter attempted to vindicate its legitimacy
by examples borrowed from the Old Testament.&mdash;<cite>Histoire de la Suisse</cite>, tom.

residence in England. Proceeding from Strasbourg on the 5th April 1549 with Paul
Fagius, he reached London on the 25th, and met with a very cordial reception at
Lambeth, in the house of Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. At the desire of his
protector, and amid the sorrows inseparable from his exile, he immediately undertook
a new translation of the Bible, which he was not permitted to finish, owing to repeated

a revision of the English Liturgy, from which he removed everything that appeared

After the long conferences, in which Farel and Fabri took part in the name of the
Church of Neuchatel, and after a correspondence of many months, the theologians of
Zurich and Geneva came to an agreement on the doctrine of the sacrament of the
Supper, and drew up a common formula, which may be seen in Hospinian.&mdash;<cite>Hist.
Sacr.</cite>, tom. ii. pp. 369, 370. It is very likely, says Ruchat, that this definite formula
was the work of Calvin. We recognize his genius in it at least, and we find in it the
same ideas and expressions met with in his Liturgy on the Holy Supper.&mdash;<cite>Hist. de la
Réf.</cite>, tom. v. p. 378. Tho adoption of this formula was the first step towards the
union of the Swiss churches, sanctioned two years after the death of Calvin (1566),
by the adoption of the famous <cite>Helvetic Confession</cite>.</p></div>

to the pressing solicitations of the Seigneury of Berne, undertook the duties of a
minister of that church in 1548. His zeal and talents, together with his prudence,
which was remarkable in one so very young, raised him to the highest offices; and

Among the numerous French refugees whom persecution led yearly to Geneva, there

from Berry, where they occupied an eminent position, and are reckoned, even in our

the letter of the Reformer is addressed, was the son of Leon Colladon, the celebrated
parliamentary advocate of Bourges, who, with his brother Germain, retired to Geneva
in the early part of the year 1551. Long initiated in evangelical doctrine, Nicolas
Colladon continued to exercise those pastoral functions in his adopted country, which
he had previously performed in Berry. In 1564 he was made Principal of the College
of Geneva, and in 1566 succeeded Calvin himself in the chair of theology, without
ceasing to discharge his pastoral duties with a zeal which, during the plague of 1570,
found a perilous opportunity of signalizing itself. He spent the last years of his life
in the Canton de Vaud. The precise date of his death is not known.&mdash;Senebier, <cite>Hist.

confusion. Some towns were so bold as to present remonstrances to the
Emperor, and protested against an arbitrary edict, which reprobated alike the
partisans of the ancient worship and those of the new. But their voice was not
heard, and the greater number of the towns submitted. There were even theologians
compliant enough to legitimize this submission. Of this number was Melanchthon,
who, by his virtues and his knowledge, deserved the first rank among the Reformed
doctors, but who, deprived now of the manly exhortations of Luther, and led away
by an excessive love of peace, and by the natural weakness of his character, was
making concessions which cannot be justified. Led by his example, and seduced by
the artifices of the Elector Maurice, the Assembly of Leipsic declared that in matters
purely <em>indifferent</em> we ought to obey the orders of our lawful superiors,&mdash;a dangerous
principle, which applied to ceremonies, and led to the revival of the grossest and
most pernicious errors of the Romish Church. Melanchthon himself wrote a great
number of the letters of [Greek: Adiáphoros]Αδιάφορος [indifferent], in support of this doctrine, and his
weakness drew down upon him the most violent reproaches from the zealous Lutherans,
who accused him of being an accomplice of the enemies of the Gospel.&mdash;Sleidan,
book xxii.; Robertson, book x. Moved by this sad news, Calvin did not hesitate
to blame Melanchthon in a letter addressed to him, in which respect and affection
are joined to a just severity.</p></div>

that, exiled from his native country from conscientious motives, this young man was
then engaged in the study of law at the University of Padua, in company with a
number of gentlemen, among others Charles de Jonvillers, Francis and Louis de Budé,
&amp;c. Their studies were intermingled with religious discourses, which contributed to
the spread of the Gospel in certain distinguished families, among which we remark
that of Contarini, originally of Padua. The increasing rigours of persecution soon
scattered this focus of Evangelism, and led some of those youthful missionaries to Geneva,
where Charles de Jonvillers, one of their number, gained the friendship of Calvin,
and became his secretary.&mdash;<cite>Divers MSS. of Gotha and of Geneva.</cite></p></div>

In a reaction, perhaps exaggerated, against the practices of the Romish Church, the
magistrates of Geneva were led to adopt a measure which made a great noise among
the Swiss Protestants. While Berne and Zurich celebrated the four great feasts of
the year, according to the ancient Catholic custom, the Genevese abolished the weekday
feasts, and kept nothing but the Sabbath. This measure, in which Calvin had
no hand whatever, and of which he, in some degree, even disapproved, was made
nevertheless the subject of very violent personal declamations against him. Some
even accused him of wishing to abolish the Sabbath. In letters to his friends, Haller,
Bullinger, and some others, he thought it his duty to represent the true character of
the reform effected at Geneva, and his real relation to it. He had little difficulty in
obtaining the approbation of Bullinger, who replied to him in these words: "You have
just given the answer which I expected, my dear brother. For I know that in matters
of that sort, where duty is but little heeded, and much ill-will is engendered, you have
never been morose. I am anxious, indeed, in such matters, to see that liberty preserved,
which I perceive to have flourished in the churches from the very days of the
apostles." ...&mdash;Calvini <cite>Opera</cite>, tom. ix. p. 63.</p></div>

punished by fine. Indulgent to the taking of oaths, of which the custom was generally
disseminated among the Catholic population subject to their dominion, the Seigneurie
seemed to reserve all their severity for the offence of not observing the feasts abolished

foreign literature, this young prince did not live long enough to realize the hopes to
which his accession to the throne had given birth. "His virtues," says the historian
Hume, "had made him an object of tender affection to the public. He possessed
mildness of disposition, application to study and business, a capacity to learn and
judge, and an attachment to equity and justice." Devotional reading had a particular

Calvin of fickleness, and went so far as to charge him with having changed his

himself thus:&mdash;"An ignorant monk, from an obscure village, disparaged me.
A ridiculous affair. He was a demagogue, who from the front of the platform, bawled
out that we were worse than the Papists, and brought forward a paper before the
Consistory, written by himself, in which he accused me, by name, of teaching what
was false and contrary to the word of God; called me an impostor; babbled out that
those who agreed with me held impious opinions," &amp;c.&mdash;(<cite>Calv. Opera</cite>, vol. ix. p. 61.)
From these last traits, we recognize the same obscure individual, who made bold to
bring forward such accusations against Calvin, and whose disputes with the Reformer
were soon to acquire a sad notoriety over all Switzerland. This man was Jerome Bolsec!&mdash;See

<p><a name="Footnote_348_348" id="Footnote_348_348"></a><a href="#FNanchor_348_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a> At a general meeting, held October 16, 1551, the minister of Jussy, Jean de Saint
André, in preaching from the words of St. John, (viii. 47,) "He that is of God heareth
God's words ...," took occasion to develope the doctrine of eternal
election, declaring that "those who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God, continue
in a state of rebellion even to the end, because obedience is a gift accorded
only to the elect." He had scarcely finished speaking when one of the hearers
rose up, and pronounced this doctrine false and impious, accompanying his discourse
with coarse abuse of those who make God the <em>author of sin</em>, and exhorted
the people to guard against this new doctrine as a detestable piece of folly. This
man was the old Carmelite monk, Jerome Bolsec, a physician, preacher, and poet,
who, wandering by turns in France and Italy, had retired to Geneva some months
previously, where he had already frequently attacked the doctrines of Calvin. Unnoticed
in the crowd, the Reformer, whom Bolsec had thought absent, immediately
rose up, and by a succession of testimonies borrowed from the writings of Augustine,
eloquently refuted his adversary. Arrested on account of the temerity of his language,
and interrogated by the magistrate, Jerome refused to retract, and was
thrown into prison. The case was brought before the Council, where he boldly
maintained his opinion, adding, besides, that many of the Swiss ministers shared
in his sentiments. Before pronouncing a judgment, which the ministers of Geneva
earnestly desired, the magistrates wrote concerning the subject to three Reformed
towns, namely, Zurich, Berne, and Bâle, furnishing them with a list of the errors of
Bolsec, and asking their advice as to how they should treat him. See the <cite>Registers

The theologians of Bâle were the first to communicate their sentiments regarding
the case of Bolsec. In a letter dated 28th November, they openly acknowledged the
doctrine which was the occasion of the dispute. They regarded election as "the effect
of a secret cause, known to God alone, and which man should not attempt to fathom."
So far as Bolsec himself was concerned, they were inclined to treat him with indulgence,
deceiving thereby the hopes of the Reformer, who desired a triumphant
condemnation of his adversary.</p></div>

to the doctrine attacked by Bolsec. "Jerome," said they, "deceives himself
and wrongs Zuingle, if he believes that the latter taught that God himself was the
cause of man's sinning; for if he appeared to teach something similar to that in his
book on <cite>The Providence of God</cite>, we must, at the same time, consult his other writings,
where he has plainly established that sin comes by no means from God, but from
human corruption and voluntary wickedness." Addressed to the Councils of Geneva
by an oversight which the ministers of that church seemed keenly to feel, the answer
from Zurich did not appear to Calvin to be a sufficiently explicit condemnation of his
adversary. See the letter to Bullinger of January 1552.</p></div>

Sienna of a distinguished family: his father, Mariano Socin, a professor in the University
of Bologna, was one of the most learned jurisconsults of his age. Of a bold
and active mind, which found pleasure in the most subtle speculations, and which
would not stop short of the interpretation of mysteries, Lelio left his native country
in 1548, and joined the Reformers of Switzerland and Germany, whose friendship he
won by the politeness of his manners, the purity of his life, and his zeal for learning.
He resided by turns at Zurich and Wittemberg, and was not slow, by correspondence
or conversation, to express his doubts on the common doctrines, which he skilfully
advanced rather in the form of questions than as opinions which he was prepared to
maintain and to teach. He was beloved by Bullinger, who did not suspect the heterodoxy
of his beliefs, and who wrote to Calvin regarding him, "I restrain as far as I
can this man's curiosity;" and Calvin himself, after having repeatedly broken off
correspondence with Socin, could not forbear renewing it, and giving a friendly reply
to the doubts which he had expressed on the resurrection, baptism, the trinity, &amp;c.
(Calv. <cite>Opera</cite>, tom. ix. pp. 51, 57, 197.) The letter, which is published here for the
first time, throws valuable light on the relation of the Reformer to the founder of a
sect to which even Socin himself was yet a stranger, and whose doubts were afterwards
to be set up as dogmas by his disciples. Lelio Socin died in 1562, before he
had completed his thirty-seventh year.&mdash;M'Crie, <cite>Hist. of Ref. in Italy</cite>, <i>passim</i>.</p></div>

of the Churches to which he had promised submission.&mdash;(<cite>Registers of the Council</cite>,

freely pleaded the cause of toleration:&mdash;"We do not believe," said they, "that it is

with too great zeal, the purity of dogmas, we swerve from the law of Jesus Christ, that
is, from charity.... Jesus Christ loved the truth, but he loved souls also; not only
those who advanced without declension, but also those who went astray. And it is
the latter of which the Good Shepherd, in the Gospel parable, takes the greatest care."...
More explicit than the theologians of Zurich and of Bâle on the doctrine which
formed the ground of the debate, the ministers of Berne gave a deliverance against
the doctrine of predestination:&mdash;"To come," said they, "to the subject of dispute with
Bolsec, you are not ignorant how much vexation it has caused very many good men,
of whom we cannot have a bad opinion, who reading in the Scriptures those passages
which exalt the grace of God to all men, have not sufficient discernment rightly to
understand the true mysteries of Divine election, attach themselves to the proclamation
of grace and of universal benevolence, and think that we cannot make God condemn,
harden, and blind any man, without being guilty of the insupportable blasphemy
of making God himself the author both of man's blindness and of his perdition, and
by consequence of all sin."&mdash;See this letter, and those of the Churches of Zurich and

spirit of the time and the stern rigour of the Reformer? The historian can only
offer conjectures: can it be Jerome Bolsec? But a regular sentence had banished
him from Geneva, and Calvin himself does not appear to have called for a more severe
judgment against this innovator whom resentment had transformed into a vile
pamphleteer. "That fellow, Jerome, is driven out into perpetual exile by a public
sentence. <em>Certain revilers have spread abroad the falsehood, that we earnestly desired
a much severer punishment, and foolishly, it is believed.</em>"&mdash;(Calvin to Bullinger, in the
month of January 1552.) In that age of inexorable severity against unsound doctrine,
Servetus only appeared at Geneva to expire at the stake, and Gentili only escaped
the scaffold for a time, by the voluntary retraction of his opinions. To name
Gentili, Servetus, Bolsec, is to recall the principal victims of Calvinistic intolerance
in the sixteenth century, but not to solve the mystery which attaches to the personage

furies. The flames were kindled, the wheel and the gallows were erected
at all the tribunals. The Protestant States of the empire, and the four Reformed
Cantons, wore active in their intercessions with the King, by means of special ambassadors,
in behalf of these poor persecuted ones; but all their prayers were useless."
(<cite>Hist. de la Réf.</cite>, tom. v. p. 479.) The King, on advising the Cantons to abstain
from any further approaches to him, declared that he wished to be allowed to remain
his own master, and to act as he pleased, and for them to refrain in future, lest those
cities continued this business at their own peril; ... that they were at
liberty to govern their own cities as they thought proper; that, for his own part, he
wished, without let or hindrance, to do the same in his own kingdom, because he intended
by all means to purge it of those <em>seditious</em> men.&mdash;(Bullinger to Calvin, tom.
ix. p. 68.) This last epithet was a <em>calumny</em>. Yet he continued, nevertheless, to persecute
the faithful of France as seditious and as rebels, because they desired to serve
and to worship God according to his word.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_372_372" id="Footnote_372_372"></a><a href="#FNanchor_372_372"><span class="label">[372]</span></a> Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of England, took an
important part in the Reformation of his country during the reigns of Henry VIII.
and Edward VI. He laboured assiduously with the Reformers of the Continent,
who esteemed his learning and honoured his character, to establish a bond of union
between the foreign churches and his own; and if he did not live to see his efforts
crowned with success, he at least left behind him an example worthy of imitation.
What is most notable in these endeavours is to be found in Cranmer's Letters to
the leading theologians of Switzerland and Germany, reproduced in the Collections
of his Works published by the <em>Parker Society</em>. They are likewise to be found in
the Collection of <cite>Zurich Letters</cite>, 1st series, vol. i. p. 21-26, from which we borrow
the following letter to Calvin, which furnishes us with the date of the Reformer's
reply to the Prelate:&mdash;"As nothing tends more injuriously to the separation of the
Churches than heresies and disputes respecting the doctrines of religion, so nothing
tends more effectually to unite the Churches of God, and more powerfully to defend
the fold of Christ, than the pure teaching of the Gospel and harmony of doctrine.
Wherefore I have often wished, and still continue to do so, that learned and godly
men, who are eminent for erudition and judgment, might meet together, and, comparing
their respective opinions, might handle all the heads of ecclesiastical doctrine,
and hand down to posterity, under the weight of their authority some work
not only upon the subjects themselves, but upon the forms of expressing them. Our
adversaries are now holding their councils at Trent, for the establishment of their
errors; and shall we neglect to call together a godly synod, for the refutation of error,
and for restoring and propagating the truth? They are, as I am informed, making
decrees respecting the worship of the host; wherefore we ought to leave no stone unturned,
not only that we may guard others against this idolatry, but also that we may
ourselves come to an agreement upon the doctrine of this sacrament. It cannot escape
your prudence how exceedingly the Church of God has been injured by dissensions
and varieties of opinion respecting the sacrament of unity; and though they are now
in some measure removed, yet I could wish for an agreement in this doctrine, not
only as regards the subject itself, but also with respect to the words and forms of expression.
You have now my wish, about which I have also written to Masters Philip
[Melanchthon] and Bullinger; and I pray you to deliberate among yourselves as to
the means by which this synod can be assembled with the greatest convenience.
Farewell.&mdash;Your very dear brother in Christ,

theology of Lausanne, and devoted to the functions of the ministry, made arrangements
for returning to their own country. These were Martial Alba of Montauban,
Peter Ecrivain of Gascony, Charles Favre of Blanzac in Angoumois, Peter Navihères
of Limousin, and Bernard Seguin of La Reole. After having spent some days at Geneva,
they set out for Lyons, and met on the way at the Bourg de Colognes, nigh to
L'Ecluse, a stranger, who offered himself as their fellow-traveller. They consented
without harbouring any suspicion. Arrived at Lyons, they parted with their travelling
companion, who pressed them to visit him at his dwelling of Ainay. They went
thither without any distrust, were arrested and led away to the prisons of that jurisdiction.
Such was the origin of a long and doleful process, which held the Churches
of France and Switzerland for a long time in suspense, and during which, the blood-thirsty
cruelty of the judges was only equalled by the constancy of the victims. On
the first rumour of the arrest of the five students, the Church of Geneva took the
matter up, and lavished upon the captives, by the voice of Calvin, the most lively testimonies
of their sympathy.</p></div>

</p>
<p>
The Reformed Church of London, next to that of Strasbourg the oldest of the
refugee churches, was formed during the first years of the reign of Edward VI., obtained
a legal recognition in 1550, had for ministers Francis Péruçel, called La
Rivière, and Richard Vanville, and as moderator an illustrious foreign nobleman, devoted
to the cause of religious reform, John A Lasco or Laski. Dispersed in 1553,
under the intolerant reign of Mary, it reconstituted itself under the reparative reign
of Elizabeth, and reckoned in the list of its pastors one of the most distinguished
ministers of Geneva, Nicolas des Gallars. In its early commencement, that Church,
which has been perpetuated to our own day, and to which the greater part of the
French Churches of England, of Scotland, and even of America, owe their origin and
their organization, was troubled by theological disputes, which made the intervention
of Calvin needful.</p></div>

<p>
Trolliet, of Geneva, a discontented and unsettled spirit, became, first of all, a hermit
in Burgundy, and lived in affectation of sanctity. Soon tired, however, of playing
this part, he re-appeared at Geneva, and solicited the functions of the ministry, from
which he was warned off by the influence of Calvin, against whom he vowed an irreconcilable
hatred. Thenceforward, he made himself remarkable in the ranks of the
libertine party, by the violence of his attacks against the Reformer. He arraigned
his writings, and offered to prove, that in the book of <cite>The Christian Institution</cite>,
Calvin had made God <em>the author of sin</em>. These accusations, emulously repeated by
the adversaries of the Reformer, and speciously tricked up with the authority of
Melanchthon, provoked sharp discussions, which were only half appeased by the
sentence of the Seigneurs of Geneva, who approved the <cite>Christian Institution</cite>, while
at the same time declaring Trolliet, "homme de bien," out of consideration for the
party to which he belonged. The whole of the papers relating to the controversy of
Calvin with Trolliet, are to be found collected in Vol. 145 of the <cite>MSS. of the Library

cavils to turn aside from this course.... The same about predestination, because
he sees now-a-days so many flighty spirits who are but too much given to curiosity,
and who go beyond bounds in this matter. Wishing to provide against this danger,
he has proposed to touch only on what was needful to be known, leaving all else
buried out of sight, rather than by disclosing all he could, to give the reins to much
perplexing and confused disputation, from whence arises no good fruit. <em>I confess
that the whole of what God has been pleased to reveal to us in Scripture ought not to be

faithful of France, he was struggling with an ever-increasing energy for the suppression
of scandals, and the formation of a new people at Geneva. His efforts, however,
seemed powerless before the enormity of the evil, and the furious resistance of that
party, which history has justly branded with the name of Libertine. The cabal of
the factious gathered strength from day to day, and disorders were committed with
impunity. The task of reforming the public morals, courageously undertaken by the
ministers, was almost absolutely fruitless. Ashamed of such excesses, but incapable
of suppressing them, the Great Council increased the severity of its edicts, but had
not the power to impose them upon the multitude who were banded together against
the <em>foreigners</em>. The French were a particular object of fury to the factions. They
beat them in the streets, and subjected them to all sorts of outrages. Most absurd
accusations were circulated against them, and were believed by the multitude. The
presence of Farel and Viret in Geneva could not quiet these troubles; and it was in
vain that these courageous ministers presented themselves before the councils, "to
commend to them the care of religion and morals."&mdash;<cite>Chronique</cite> of Roset, c. v. pp. 42,

maintained a long silence, which was only broken on the 1st October 1552, by a
touching letter to Calvin:&mdash;"Reverend sir and very dear brother,&mdash;I should have

living as if in a wasps' nest. But perhaps I shall ere long put off this mortal life
for a brighter companionship in heaven." Full of affection and respect for Melanchthon,
whose character he venerated, while he freely blamed him for his weakness
and indecision, Calvin made known, in turn, to the German Reformer, the
struggles of all sorts which he had to undergo at Geneva, and with which the name
of Melanchthon himself is found mixed up, owing to the astute intrigues of the
Libertines, who had an interest in involving these two great men in mutual opposition.</p></div>

"After that monk let loose against us from the service of M. de Falais had been condemned,
a plot having been clandestinely hatched, a noisy fellow was found who, not
only at table in private families, but up and down the taverns, kept constantly bawling,
that we made God the author of sin, and otherwise traduced our ministry in the
most insulting manner possible. When I saw that these evenomed words were spread
about everywhere, by means of which profligate men were intriguing, by no means
covertly, to overthrow the whole kingdom of Christ in this city, I mildly admonished
the people to be on their guard against them. I also pointed out to the Senate how
dangerous dilatory measures were in such dissensions. Those who had suborned him
to molest me, by their intrigues so protracted the cause, that I was kept in suspense
upwards of three months. For among the judges there were several who favoured the
adverse party. But among many injuries, there was nothing I felt more keenly and
bitterly than that this affair forced me into a hateful contest with M. Philip, with
whom, however, I broke in such a manner that I never spoke of so great a man except

<p><a name="Footnote_402_402" id="Footnote_402_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_402_402"><span class="label">[402]</span></a> We can judge of this from the remarkable memorial of Calvin to the Seigneurie,
entitled <cite>La Cause contre Trolliet</cite>, where we meet with these words:&mdash;"That party,
Noble Seigneurs, which is desirous of bringing Melanchthon and myself into mutual
conflict, is doing great wrong to both of us, and in general to the whole Church of
God. I honour Melanchthon as much for his superior learning as for his virtues, and
above all, for having laboured so faithfully to uphold the Gospel. If I find fault with
him, I do not conceal it from him, seeing that he gives me liberty to do so. There
are witnesses in abundance on his side, who know how much he loves me. And I
know that he will hold in detestation all those who, under cover of his name, seek to
blacken my doctrine."&mdash;6th Oct. 1552. (Library of Geneva, vol. 145.) Calvin's preface
to Melanchthon's <cite>Common Places</cite> may also be consulted. Geneva, 1546, 8vo.
</p>
<p>
Osiander had published many writings against Melanchthon, in which, by a strange
reversing of the orthodox doctrine, he attempted to derive Justification from God the
Father, by forgetting the part which belonged to Jesus Christ as the Redeemer. See
Seckendorf, and Melch. Adam, p. 229.</p></div>

Calvin wrote to M. de Falais, throws a great light on the circumstances of their rupture,
of which Jerome Bolsec's process was the occasion. Banished from Geneva for
his attacks on the doctrine of predestination and his invectives against Calvin, Bolsec
had found means to interest in his cause M. de Falais, whose physician he was, and
who interceded to no purpose for him with his judges: "Master Jerome is better acquainted
with my constitution and what affords me relief than any other doctor that
I know.... It is to him after God that I am indebted for my life."&mdash;<cite>Archives
of Geneva.</cite> Letters of the 9th and 11th November 1551. These steps undertaken
from a feeling of humanity, would certainly not have indisposed Calvin, if M. de
Falais had not too openly taken part with Bolsec against the Reformer. Calvin
bitterly complained of it, "that M. de Falais should write that he (Bolsec) was not a
bad man, and for the sake of an obscure wretch should hold up his reputation as a
subject of mockery." Letter to the ministers of Bâle, January 1552. Expelled from
Geneva and settled at Thonon, Bolsec contrived to envenom this difference which the
recollections of a long friendship should have appeased, and which terminated in a
painful rupture. In a vehement letter, Calvin, at that time suffering from bad health,
took leave of his old friend, whose name he erased four years afterwards from the preface
to his Commentary on the first Epistle to the Corinthians, in order to substitute
in its place that of the Marquis de Vico.</p></div>

obscurity. He left Geneva in order to settle at Berne, lost his wife in 1557, and contracted
a second marriage. We know neither the date nor the place of his death. Is
it true, as Bayle affirms, that this seigneur, chagrined by the spectacle of the divisions
which he had witnessed at Geneva, at last returned to the Catholic church? We are
rather inclined to believe, from the testimonies of Calvin and Beza, indirectly confirmed
by the silence of the Brabançon historians, that, though differing on some
points of Calvinistic theology, the great-grand-son of Philip of Burgundy did not
abjure the tenets for which he had sacrificed his fortune and his country. See Bayle,

Dimonet underwent a first examination, and was then led away to the prison of the

for on the one side, they set before me tortures and death, then the shame and dishonour
of myself and my relations, the sorrow of my mother, who they said was dying
with grief and many other things ... which would have been
very hard for me to bear, unless the Lord had strengthened me by his Holy Spirit."

The 21st May 1552. The Seigneury of Berne, informed of the arrest of the five
Scholars of Lausanne, had written to the King of France to solicit the deliverance
of their "pensionaires." The burgomaster of Zurich, John Hab, obtained an
audience of this prince and found him inflexible. The following year, March 1553,
the Bernese solicited anew the pardon of the five prisoners, condemned by the
official of Lyons and the parliament of Paris. It is to this last intercession, urged
forward by Calvin and Viret, that the letter of the Reformer to the brothers Zollicoffre
refers.</p></div>

complaint of the conduct of the Cardinal de Tournon, who, after having promised
them to interest himself in behalf of the five students, had, with the utmost rigour,
instituted proceedings against them. In a second letter, written three days later,
they represented to this prince the innocence of their scholars, arrested at Lyons
before they had sojourned there a single day, and condemned to death, although they
had neither preached, nor dogmatized, nor excited any disturbance in the kingdom.
They concluded by saying,&mdash;"We very humbly pray your Majesty to bestow them on
us as a pure, royal, gratuitous, and liberal gift, which we shall esteem as great and
precious, as if a present had been made us of an inestimable amount of gold and
silver." These petitions were of no avail. Inspired by the fatal genius of the Cardinals
of Tournon and of Lorraine, Henry II. confirmed the sentence of the parliament

prisoners. Foreseeing their end near, they wrote, on the 5th May, to the Seigneurie
of Berne, to thank them for the testimonials of affection which they had received
from them. "If it has not pleased God," they said, "to preserve life by your
means, it has at least been prolonged thereby ... in spite of the fury of all
those who would have desired long ago to put us to death. Since, then, that He
is pleased that our blood should soon be shed for the confession of his holy name,
we reckon ourselves far happier than if we were set at liberty, for as he is true
and all-powerful, he will strengthen us, and will not permit us to be tormented
beyond our strength; and after that we have suffered awhile, he will receive us
into his heavenly kingdom, and will bestow upon us eternal rest with himself...."
It was the 16th May when the five scholars were told to prepare for
death; they received that intelligence with a pious serenity. The stake was set
up upon the <em>Place des Terreaux</em>; they proceeded thither, singing psalms, and
repeating passages of holy writ. "Having arrived at the place of death, they
cheerfully mounted on the heap of wood, the two youngest first.... The
last who went up was Martial Alba, the elder of the five, who had been a long
time on his knees in prayer to the Lord. He earnestly requested Lieutenant
Tignac to grant him a favour. The lieutenant said to him: What would you?
He said to him: That I might kiss my brethren before I die. The lieutenant
granted his wish. Then the said Martial kissed the other four who were already
bound, saying to each of them, <em>Adieu, adieu, my brother</em>. The fire was kindled;
the voice of the five confessors was heard, still exhorting one another in the midst of
the flames: <em>Courage, my brothers; courage</em>.... These were the last

with Servetus, and of the rupture of that connection as attested by the letter of Calvin
to John Frellon (13th February 1546). Wandering by turns in France, Germany, and
Italy, Servetus had taken up his residence at Vienne in Dauphiné, where he at once
exercised the profession of a doctor, and persisted in his daring attacks on Christianity,
for which he aspired to substitute a rational philosophy. Such is the drift of his book
entitled <cite>Christianismi Restitutio</cite>, which he published anonymously in 1553, after
having two-and-twenty years before directed his bold attacks against the doctrine of
the Trinity, in his book <cite>De Trinitatis Erroribus</cite>, published at Haguenau in 1531.
Accused by a Genevan refugee before the Inquisition of Lyons, as the author of these
writings, Servetus was arrested, cast into the dungeons of Vienne, and condemned by
Catholic judges to be burnt, from which he only escaped by flight. Hear how Theodore
Beza recounts, in his letter to Bullinger, the preparations for the trial of Servetus,
of his escape from prison, and of his arrival and arrest at Geneva:&mdash;"You have heard
doubtless of that impious blasphemer Servetus. He caused a book, or rather volume
of his blasphemies to be secretly printed at Lyons. Certain good brethren at Lyons
informed the magistrate of this deceitful action. Persons were despatched to Vienne,
where he was practising as a physician, to bring him bound [to Lyons]. He was
seized, but soon after effected his escape by deceit. At length he came to Geneva,
where he went skulking about. He was forthwith recognized, however, by a certain
person, and cast into prison. Calvin also, whom he treated very unhandsomely by
name in thirty printed letters, pled the cause of the Church against him in the
Council, in the presence of a great assemblage of the pious. He continued in his impiety.
What will come of it I know not. Let us pray the Lord to purge his Church
of these monsters."&mdash;<cite>MSS. of Zurich.</cite> Letter of the 27th August 1553. Such was the
opening of the process which terminated so fatally for Servetus. Born in an age not
disposed to show mercy to errors of faith, he seems, says a historian, to have fled from
Spain&mdash;the native country of the auto-da-fé&mdash;only to see his effigy burnt in a strange
land by the torch of a Catholic executioner, and to come afterwards to expire amid
flames kindled by Calvinistic justice.&mdash;Albert Rilliet, <cite>Relation du Procès Criminel

mitigate the severity of his punishment, you act the part of a friend to a man who is
most hostile to you. But I beseech you so to manage the matter that no one whatever
may rashly dare to publish new dogmas, and throw all things into confusion
with impunity for such a length of time as he has done." In his relentless rigour
against heresy, Farel did not hesitate to pronounce himself even to be worthy of
death if he should teach any dogma opposed to the faith. His words deserve to be
recorded:&mdash;"When I read Paul's statement that he did not refuse to suffer death if
he had in any way deserved it, I saw clearly that I must be prepared to suffer death
if I should teach anything contrary to the doctrine of piety. And I added, that I
should be most worthy of any punishment whatever, if I should seduce any one from
the faith and doctrine of Christ."&mdash;8th Sept. 1553. Calv. <cite>Opera</cite>, tom. ix. p. 71</p></div>

were only separated to die. Denis Peloquin was taken from his prison the 4th September,
and conducted to Ville Franche, where his heroic constancy at the stake excited
the wonder and tender sympathy of the spectators. Louis de Marsac, with two
other victims, Etienne Gravot of Gyen, and Marsac, his cousin, who had followed him
into his dungeon, "gave thanks to God for the inestimable honour which he conferred
upon them of suffering for his name." At the moment when the three condemned
were about to be led to the place of execution, a rope was put about their
neck, according to custom. "Louis de Marsac, seeing that they spared him in that
particular, out of some regard to his quality, asked in a loud voice if the cause of his
two brethren was different from his, adding these words, 'Alas! do not refuse me the
collar of so excellent an order.' The lieutenant agreed to his wish, and the three
martyrs, chanting with one voice the song of deliverance, shortly after mounted the

confession of the accused, there had been printed a thousand copies of the <cite>Christianismi

not forget the latter portion of this acknowledgment, confirmed besides by a letter
from the printer at Vienne, but wrote immediately to the Church of Frankfort, desiring
the sequestration and destruction of this dangerous deposit. A clerk of the
celebrated printer, Robert Stephens, then resident at Geneva, was charged with this
mission, which he accomplished with so very great success, that there are only <em>three</em>
copies of the original edition to be found at the present day; one in the Imperial

by the Consistory for his irregular habits, and appealed to the Council of State,
which annulled the ecclesiastical sentence, and gave Berthelier authority to go forward
to the Supper. The experiment was decisive; it was made to know whether
or not Calvin would abandon ecclesiastical discipline, or resist the government.
This letter of the Reformer to Viret, shows us with what energetic resolution and
heroic constancy he resolved, in this instance, to maintain the honour of Christ.

was not, however, till the 21st of September, that the messenger, charged with
the various papers relative to the trial, had put into his hands the circular letter
addressed to the magistrates or pastors of the four towns. These letters were accompanied
by a copy of the <cite>Christianismi Restitutio</cite>, a copy of the works of Tertullian,
and one of those of Irenæns, as well as the questions put to Servetus,
together with his replies, and the refutation of the ministers. In those circulars,
the council gave expression to its entire confidence in the intelligence of the
pastors of Geneva, but desired, before coming to a decision, to have fuller information
on the point, by consulting the other Churches. The fate of the prisoner
evidently depended on the result of this supreme measure. Calvin, addressing
Bullinger and Sulzer alternately, insisted strongly on the alleged culpability of
Servetus, and on the necessity of a punishment, which should be, as it appeared
to him, a solemn consecration of those truths which had been shaken by the
attacks of the audacious Spanish doctor. The messenger charged with the letter
to Sulzer was the Treasurer Du Pan, one of the most devoted disciples of the
Reformer.</p></div>

the coast of Saintonge, peopled by fishermen and pirates, received the first seeds of the
Gospel from some refugees driven away by persecution from the neighbouring towns.
"The seed sown was afterwards fertilized by some monks preaching a kind of half
truth, as regarded doctrine, and reproving vices; so that in a little time we saw (in

point of Arvert, the Reformation spread into the adjoining islets, and there made
numerous disciples, in spite of the rigours of the Parliament of Bourdeaux. A great
missionary, Philibert Hamelin, regulated this movement. From Tours originally, he
at first preached the Reformed doctrine with success at Saintes. Seized in that town,
he miraculously escaped death, and sought an asylum at Geneva, where he followed
the calling of a printer. But the ardour of his zeal soon led him to betake himself
once more to the perilous apostolate, which was to close with martyrdom. He revisited
La Saìntonge, visited his brethren dispersed among the islands, organized their
churches, and taken a second time, he perished at the stake at Bourdeaux, the 18th
April 1557. The journal of another glorious missionary of the Reformation, Bernard
Palissy, may be consulted as to the ministry and death of Hamelin.</p></div>

trial of Servetus to the Swiss Churches, had visited in succession those of Berne,
Zurich, Schaffhausen, and Bâle, and had now returned to Geneva with their replies.
The churches were alike unanimous in their judgment of the theological culpability
of Servetus, and in their testimonies of affection and confidence towards Calvin and
his colleagues. Without giving expression to the nature of the punishment which
should be inflicted on the accused, they were unanimous in advising them to rid the
Church of a pest, which had already brought ruin to so great a number of souls.
Their various replies will be found in <cite>Calvini Opera</cite>, tom. ix. p. 72, <i>et seq.</i> The
magistrates of Berne, who had counselled toleration to Bolsec, manifested an inflexible
rigour towards Servetus, exhorting those of Geneva not to act unworthily of Christian
magistrates. The ministers of Zurich were still more decided: "We think," said
they, "that you ought in this case to manifest much faith and zeal, inasmuch as our
churches have abroad the bad reputation of being heretical, and of being particularly
favourable to heresy. Holy Providence at this time affords you an opportunity of
freeing yourselves and us from that injurious suspicion, if you know how to be vigilant
and active in preventing the further spreading of that poison, and we have no doubt
but that your Seigneurs will do so." After such replies the sentence against Servetus
could not be long doubtful; and the magistrates, in condemning him to death, were
only the interpreters of the stern thought of an age in which persecution, that sad
legacy of the Middle Ages, was the avowed jurisprudence of all Christian communions.
The day following that on which Calvin penned these lines addressed to Farel, (27th
October 1553,) Servetus was led forth to hear his doom pronounced at the gate of the
Hotel de Ville, and mounted the fatal pile erected at Champel, bequeathing a mournful
souvenir to the Reformation, and an eternal subject of accusation to the enemies of the
Reformer. The error of Calvin in the death of Servetus was, we may say, altogether
that of his age, inasmuch as men of the most conciliating and moderate dispositions,
viz., Bucer, &OElig;colampadius, Melanchthon, and Bullinger, were at one in their approval
of the condemnation of the unfortunate Spanish innovator. One may deeply deplore
this error without insulting the Reformation, and combine in a just measure that pity
which a great victim demands, with respect for those men whom an unhappy time
made the accusers and the judges of Servetus.</p></div>

Philibert Berthelier, Calvin presented himself before the Council, and demanded a
general assembly of the people. The Council could not, he said, annul a discipline
which the entire people had sanctioned. Intimidated by this step, the Council
adopted the course which it had already followed in the case of Servetus, and expressed
the intention of consulting the other Reformed Cantons. Charged with a
secret mission by the Reformer, his friend John de Budé set out for Zurich, to
solicit in that place, a decision favourable to the views of Calvin. Bullinger was
active in his exertions to gain over the magistrates of his country, as well as in
giving Calvin wise counsels of moderation:&mdash;"We have laboured with all our
might," he wrote to him, "to prevent our Seigneurs from acting in any way derogatory

faithful, using moderation in all things, lest you lose those whose salvation is desired

of Zurich had paid, in their reply to the Seigneurie of Geneva, a very beautiful tribute

magistrates of Geneva to maintain their ecclesiastical laws, "as good and conformable
to the prescriptions of the Divine word, and as particularly necessary in an age in
which men are becoming more and more wicked." Although the discipline then in
operation at Zurich differed essentially from that of Geneva, in being less rigorous,
yet the Seigneurs of Zurich pronounced a eulogy upon that of the latter, "inasmuch
as it was framed in a manner adapting it to the time, the place, and the persons; and
that every Church ought to persevere in those usages which she has received and
holily established, according to the word of God."&mdash;Ruchat, <cite>Hist. de la Reformation</cite>,
